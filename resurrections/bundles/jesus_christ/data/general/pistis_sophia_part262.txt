that  lion-faced  power  [once  did]  ;  for  thy  light 
is  no  longer  with  me,  nor  thy  light-stream  to 
preserve  me.  Nay,  Adamas  is  enraged  against 
me,  saying,  "  'Tis  thou  who  hast  kept  my 
power  in  the  chaos."  Now,  therefore,  0  light 
of  lights,  if  I  have  done  so,  if  I  have  kept  it 
there,  if  I  have  done  the  least  violence  to  that 
power,  or  if  I  have  constrained  it  as  it  con- 
strained me,  let  all  these  rulers  which  pursue 
after  me,  take  away  my  light,  let  them  leave 
me  empty ;  let  Adamas  my  foe  pursue  after 
my  power,  let  him  seize  upon  it,  let  him  take 
from  me  my  light,  let  him  cast  it  into  his  dark 
power,  which  is  in  chaos,  let  him  put  my  power 
in  chaos.  (172)  Now,  therefore,  0  light,  raise 
thou  me  up  in  thy  [just]  wrath,  lift  up  thy 
power  above  mine  enemies,  who  have  raised 
themselves  up  against  me  unto  the  end.  Haste 
thee,  restore  me,  as  thou  saidst  unto  me,  "  I  will 
help  thee."'"

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the  first 
mystery  had  finished  speaking  these  words  unto 
his  disciples,  that  he  said  :  "  Let  him  who  hath 
understood  the  words  which  I  have  spoken, 
come  forward  and  expound  their  interpretation."

And  James  came  forward,  and  said  :  "  Master, 
concerning  this  song  which  Pistis  Sophia  sang, 
thy  light-power  prophesied  of  old,  through 
David,  in  the  seventh  Psalm,  saying  :
