And  when  the  saviour  had  said  these  things, 
Mary  Magdalene  came  forward  and  said  :  "  Mas- 
ter, bear  with  me,  and  be  not  wroth  with  me,  if 
I  question  on  every  matter  with  earnestness  and 
confidence.  Now,  therefore,  my  Master,  surely 
there  is  no  other  word  of  the  mystery  of  that 
ineffable,  nor  any  other  word  of  the  whole 
gnosis  ?  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  :  "  Yea,  verily  ; 
there  is  another  mystery  of  that  ineffable  and 
another  word  of  the  whole  gnosis."

And  Mary  answered  again  and  said  unto  the 
saviour  :  "  Master,  bear  with  me  if  I  question 
thee,  and  be  not  wroth  with  me.  Now,  there- 
fore, 0  Master,  if  we  tarry  not  in  life  until  we 
know  ^he  gnosis  of  the  whole  word  of  that  in- 
effable, shall  we  not  inherit  the  light-king- 
dom ? "

(233)  The   saviour   answered   and   said  unto 
Mary  :    "  Yea,    verily  ;    every    one    of  of  the  dis- 
those  who  shall  receive  a  mystery  of  between

existence,  unless  he  knoweth  the  only  word  of 
that  ineffable,  that  is  to  say,  the  gnosis  of  the 
pleroma  ;  farther  and  in  all  openness,  I  am  the 
gnosis  of  the  pleroma.  Nor  is  there  any  pos-

a  mystery  of  light,  each  shall  enter  therein  to 
inherit  up  to  the  region  of  which  he  shall  have 
received  the  mystery.
