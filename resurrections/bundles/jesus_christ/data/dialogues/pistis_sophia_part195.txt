''Ha,  ha!  our  eyes  are  filled  with  the  sight  of 
him."  Thou  hast  seen,  0  lord.  0  lord,  keep 
no  longer  silence ;  go  not  far  from  me,  0  lord. 
(97)  Arise,  0  lord  ;  give  heed  to  my  retribu- 
tion ;  give  heed  to  my  vindication,  my  God  and 
my  lord.  Let  them  not  rejoice  over  me,  0  my 
God,  and  let  them  not  say,  "  Well  done,  our 
soul."  Let  them  not  say,  "  We  have  devoured 
him."  Let  them  be  ashamed,  and  let  them 
be  also  confounded,  who  rejoice  at  my  evils. 
Let  them  be  covered  with  shame  and  confusion 
who  speak  great  words  against  me.  Let  them 
that  favour  my  righteousness,  rejoice  and  be 
glad ;  let  them  say,  "  May  the  lord  be  great "  ; 
let  them  be  exalted  who  desire  the  peace 
of  his  servants.  My  tongue  shall  be  joyful 
in  thy  righteousness  and  praise  all  the  day 
long.'  "
