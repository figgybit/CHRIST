It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples,  that 
Mary  Magdalene  came  forward  and  said  r 
"  Master,  how  many  years  in  years  of  the  world 
is  a  year  of  the  light  ?  "

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  :  "  A  day 
What  is  a  of  the  light  is  a  thousand  years  in  the 
Ught.  world,   so   that   thirty-six    myriads   of

years  and  a  half  myriad  of  years  of  the  world 
make  a  single  year  of  the  light.

"  I  shall,  therefore,  pass  a  thousand  years 
of  the  light  reio-nino;  in  the  midst  of  the  last 
supporter  over  all  the  emanations  of  the  light, 
over  the  total  number  of  the  souls  who  shall  have 
received  the  mysteries  of  the  light.
