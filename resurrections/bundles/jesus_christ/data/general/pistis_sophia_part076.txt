Believing  as  they  did,  that  the  orthodox  life  of  Jesus  was 
legendary  and  allegorical,  and  finding  many  other  legends 
current  which  were  not  included  in  the  Synoptic  account ;

INTRODUCTION.  XXV

devoted  to  the  mystic  life,  and  making  light  of  the  liistorical 
side  of  religion,  with  faith  alone  in  the  watchword  "  now 
and  within,"  it  is  evident  that  their  views  met  with  little 
favour  among  the  orthodox  who  clung  above  all  things  to 
what  they  held  to  be  the  greatest  fact  of  all  history.  The 
ancient  wisdom,  however,  proved  far  too  difficult  for 
popular  comprehension,  and  being  also  misunderstood  even 
by  the  followers  of  the  great  doctors  themselves  in  many 
cases,  often  degenerated  into  superstition  and  the  wildest  of 
speculations.

But,  as  we  are  not  attempting  to  trace  the  evolution  of 
the  movement,  but  simply  presenting  one  of  the  better 
sides  of  the  endeavour,  we  will  proceed  to  a  consideration  of 
the  document  we  are  especially  interested  in,  at  the  same 
time  reminding  the  reader  that  in  this  Introduction  only  a 
brief  outline  of  the  MS.  will  be  attempted,  and  all  further 
considerations  will  be  postponed  for  a  further  Commentary 
which  the  writer  has  the  intention  of  undertaking.

The  only  MS.  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  known  to  exist  was

bought  by  the  British  Museum  from  the  heirs  of

Dr.  Askew  at  the  end  of  the  last  century,  and  is  ^jon  and

now  catalogued  as  MS.  Add.  51U.     The  title  on  criticism
