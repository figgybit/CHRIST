Woide  not  only  carefully  copied  the  whole  of  the  MS. 
but  also  the  Codex  Brucianus  at  Oxford.  He  gives  the  date 
of  the  MS.  as  about  the  fourth  century,  and  considers  the 
writer  to  have  been  Valentinus.  He,  however,  published 
no  work  on  the  subject.

baice  et  Latine,  Prefatione  et  Adnotationibiis  Philo- 
logicis  Illustratfe  (Hafnise).

Bishop  Miinter,  a  learned  Dane,  probably  got  his  text 
from  Woide's  copy  ;  his  brief  pamphlet  is  of  no  particular 
importance,  nevertheless  it  was  solely  upon  these  few  brief 
selections,  the  seven  Odes  of  Solomon,  that,  with  the  ex- 
ception of  Dulaurier,  scholars  formed  their  opinion  of  the 
Pistis  Sophia  up  to  the  time  of  the  publication  of  Schwartze's 
work  in  1851.  Miinter  believes  that  the  original  treatise 
belongs  to  the  second  century.
