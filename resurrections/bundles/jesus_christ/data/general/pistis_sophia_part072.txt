Nor  is  the  reason  of  this  ill-success  mostly  due  to  the 
paucity  of  material,  but  rather  to  the  intrinsic  difficulty  of 
the  subject  itself,  which  is  not  only  replete  with  the  most 
involved  mysticism,  but  also  bound  up  with  magic  and 
mystery  and  occasionally  sorcery  of  every  kind.  It  is, 
therefore,  not  a  matter  of  great  surprise,  when  we  remember 
the  absolute  disbelief  of  scholarship  in  magic  of  any  kind, 
and  the  distaste  of  the  present  age  for  everything  connected 
with  mysticism,  to  find  that  no  single  writer  on  the  subject, 
except  perhaps  King  in  a  very  feeble  fashion,  has  really 
grappled  with  the  problem.  The  point  of  view  of  the  most 
liberal-minded  scholars  with  regard  to  this  tabooed  subject 
may  be  seen  from  the  remarks  of  Dr.  Gaster,  who  would 
have  magic  trecxted  after  the  fashion  of  folklore.  The 
translator  of  The  Sword  of  Moses  in  the  second  paragraph 
of  his  introduction  (loc.  sup.  cit.)  writes  :  "  It  is  remarkable 
that  we  do  not  possess  a  good  work,  or  exhaustive  study, 
on  the  history  and  development  of  magic.  It  is  true  that 
we  find  allusions  to  it,  and  sometimes  special  chapters 
devoted  to  the  charms  and  incantations  and  other  super- 
stitious customs  prevailing  among  various  nations  in  books 
dealing  with  such  nations.  But  a  comprehensive  study 
of  magic  is  still  a  pious  (or  impious)  wish."  And,  even 
were  such  a  task  attempted  by  some  venturesome  scholar, 
the  result,  we  may  venture  to  suggest,  would  at  best  be 
merely  a  guess-work  compilation,  and  of  no  real  value, 
unless  the  compiler  in  addition  to  his  scholarship  had  not 
only  a  belief  in  but  also  a  knowledge  of  the  art.
