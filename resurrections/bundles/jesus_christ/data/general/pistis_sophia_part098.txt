"  The  MS.  from  which  the  work  is  published  belongs 
to  the  collection  of  MSS.  collected  by  Di*.  Askew  of  London 
during  his  travels  in  Italy  and  Greece,  of  which  the 
British  Theological  Magazine  (das  Brittische  theol.  Magazin) 
for  the  year  1770  (vol.  i.  part  4,  p.  22.3)  gives  more  particu- 
lars."

There  is  no  such  magazine  in  the  catalogue  of  the 
British  Museum.  The  Theological  Repository  for  1770 
contains  no  information  on  the  subject;  and  no  permutation 
of  names  solves  the  mystery.  There  were  very  few 
magazines  published  at  that  early  date,  so  that  the  choice 
is  limited.

m.  1856.  An  anonymous  translation  in  Migne's  Dictionnaire 
des  Apocrj'pbes,  torn.  i.  app.  part  ii.  coll.  1181- 
1286 ;  this  tome  forms  vol.  xxiii.  of  bis  third 
Encyclopedie  Tbeologique.

The  translation  is  a  soiTy  piece  of  work,  more  frequently 
a  mere  paraphrase  from  Schwartze's  version  thau  a  trans- 
lation ;    there   are   also  frequent   omissions,  sometimes  as

many  as  40  pagesof  the  Coptic  Codex;  e.g.,  pp.  18,  19, 
36  sq.,  50,  51,  72,  73,  86-90,  108-135,  139,  157-160,  162, 
171,  179,  180,  184-186,  221-243,  245-255,  281-320,  324- 
342.  These  are  some  of  the  omissions  ;  but  there  are  many 
more.  It  is,  therefore,  entirely  useless  to  the  student.  The 
anonymous  writer  vaguely  suggests  a  late  date  for  the 
treatise  because  of  the  complicated  nature  of  the  system.

n.  1860.  Lipsius  (R.  A.).  Article  "  Gnosticismus  "  in  Ersch  and 
Gruber's  Encyclopaedie,  separately  published  at 
Leipziff,  1860,  pp.  95  sq.  and  157  sq.  ;  also  Article
