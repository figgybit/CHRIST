speak  unto  you,  your  thrones  shall  be  close  to 
mine  in  my  kingdom.

"  Wherefore  have  I  said  unto  you  aforetime, 
'  In  the  place  where  I  shall  be,  there  will  be 
also  my  twelve  ministers,  but  Mary  Magdalene 
and  John,  the  virgin,  shall  be  higher  than  all 
the  disciples.*

"  And  all  men  who  shall  receive  the  mystery 
in  that  ineffable,  shall  be  on  my  left  hand  and 
on  my  right,  and  I  am  they,  and  they  are  my- 
self.

"  They  shall  be  your  equals  in  all  things,  and 
yet  your  thrones  shall  be  more  excellent  than 
theirs,  and  my  throne  shall  be  more  excellent 
than  yours  (232)  and  [than  those  of]  all  men
