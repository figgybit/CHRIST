the  doctrines  of  error,  and  of  those  who  teach 
such  doctrines,  and  also  of  them  that  have  inter- 
course with  males,  of  the  polluted  and  impious, 
atheists,  murderers,  adulterers,  sorcerers,  all 
souls,  then,  of  this  kind,  if  they  have  not  re- 
pented while  still  in  life,  and  have  remained 
persistently  in  their  sin,  (323)  and  all  the  other 
souls  which  have  remained  without  [the  light- 
world],  that  is  to  say,  who  have  exhausted  the 
number  of  the  cycles  apportioned  to  them  in  the 
sphere  without  repenting — they  take  hold  of 
those  souls,  in  their  last  cycle,  them  and  all  the 
souls  which  I  have  just  enumerated  for  you,  and 
carry  them  through  the  opening  in  the  tail  of 
the  dragon  into  the  dungeons  of  the  outer  dark- 
ness. And  when  they  have  finished  bringing 
those  souls  into  the  outer  darkness  by  the  open- 
ing in  its  tail,  it  putteth  back  its  tail  again  into 
its  mouth  and  shutteth  them  in.  This  is  the 
way  in  which  souls  are  brought  into  the  outer 
darkness.

"  And  the  dragon  of  the  outer  darkness  hath 
twelve  authentic  names  which  are  r^j^g  nature 
written  on  its  doors,  a  name  for  the   °1*^®    ,

'  names  of

twelve  names  are  all  different  from  one  another, 
but  all  twelve  are  contained  one  in  the  other,  so 
that  he  who  uttereth  one  name  will  utter  all. 
And  these  will  I  tell  you,  when  I  explain  the

emanation  of  the  pleroma.  This,  then,  is  the 
way  in  which  is  the  outer  darkness,  which  is  also 
the  dragon."

When  the  saviour  had  spoken  these  things,  Mary 
answered  and  said  unto  the  saviour  :  (324) 
"  Master,  are  the  torments  of  this  dragon  terrible 
beyond  the  punishment  of  all  the  judgments  ?  "
