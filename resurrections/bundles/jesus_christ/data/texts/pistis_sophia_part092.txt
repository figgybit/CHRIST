In  1890  I  had  already  translated  Schwartze's  Latin 
version  into  English  and  published  pages  1  to  252,  with  a 
commentary,  notes,  etc.,  in  magazine  form  from  April,  1890, 
to  April,  1891.  But  I  hesitated  to  put  it  forward  in  book 
form,  and  should  not  have  done  so,  but  for  the  appearance 
of  Amelineau's  French  version  in  1895.  I  then  retranslated 
the  whole  book  again  and  checked  it  by  Amelineau's  version. 
I  was  further  induced  to  venture  on  this  undertaking, 
because  the  narrative,  though  dealing  with  mystical  and 
therefore  obscure  subjects,  is  in  itself  exceedingly  simple, 
and  therefore  mistakes  cannot  so  readily  creep  in  as  into  a 
difhcult  philosophical  work.  I,  therefore,  present  my  trans- 
lation with  all  hesitation,  but  at  the  same  time  think  that 
the  English  public,  which  is  steadily  increasing  its  interest 
in  mysticism  and  allied  subjects,  will  be  better  satisfied  with 
half  a  loaf  than  with  no  bread.

In  conclusion  it  only  remains  for  me  to  append  a  brief 
fjij^g  siimmary  of  the  work  that  has  already  been  done

work  on  the  subject.     This  may  best  be  seen  by  treating

been  pre-  ^^  f  I'om  a  chronological  point  of  view.  In  addition 
viously  to  a  few  scattered  articles  in  magazines  which  are 
not  of  the  first  importance,  the  chief  contributions 
to  the  subject  are  :

a.  1770.     Article  in  Britti#clie  Theol.Magaziii;  see  Kostlin  infra.

b.  1773.     Woide  (C.  A.).     Article  in  Journal  de  Savants.

c.  1778.     Woide.     Article  in  J.  A.  Cramer's  BeyLrage  zur  Befo-

clerung  theologischer  and  andrer  wichtigen  Kennt- 
nisse  (Kiel  u.  Hamburg),  pp.  82  sq.

d.  1799.     Woide.     Appendix    ad    Editionem    Novi   Testamenti
