confusion  (24)  and  great  fear  reached  to  the 
region  of  the  great  invisible  forefather,  and  of 
the  three  great  triple  powers.  Because  of  the 
great  fear  of  their  confusion,  the  great  forefather 
himself,  and  the  three  triple  powers,  began  to 
run  hither  and  thither  in  their  region,  and  they 
could  not  close  all  their  regions  because  of  the 
great  fear  in  which  they  were.  They  threw  into 
confusion  all  their  seons  together,  with  all  their 
spheres  and  orderings,  fearing  and  being  greatly 
troubled  because  of  the  great  light  that  was  in 
me — far  different  from  what  it  was  when  I  was 
on  the  earth  of  human  kind,  when  my  shining 
vesture  came  upon  me,  for  the  earth  could  not 
have  borne  the  light  such  as  it  was  in  reality, 
else  would  the  world  be  resolved  and  all  upon  it 
at  the  same  time.  But  the  light  which  was  in 
me  in  the  twelve  seons  was  .  .  .  myriad, 
and  seven  thousand  and  eight  hundred  times 
greater  than  when  I  was  in  the  world  among 
you.

"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  all  those 
who  are  in  the  twelve  seons  had  seen    Adamas 
the  great  light  which  was  in  me,  that   t^^nt?
