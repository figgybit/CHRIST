to  speak.  pretation  of  the  words  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake."

And  Jesus  answered,  and  said  unto  her : 
"  Thou  also,  0  Mary,  thou  who  didst  receive 
the  form  which  is  in  Barbelo,  according  to 
matter,  and  didst  receive  the  similitude  of  the 
regions  of  light,  according  to  the  light,  thou  and 
the  other  Mary,  the  blessed  one ;  the  darkness 
hath  existed  because  of  thee,  and  moreover  from 
thee  did  come  forth  the  material  body  in  which  I 
dwell,  and  which  I  have  purified — now,  there- 
fore, I  bid  thee  utter  the  interpretation  of  the 
words  spoken  by  Pistis  Sophia."

And  Mary,  the  mother  of  Jesus,  answered, 
and  said  :  "  My  Master,  thy  light-power  hath 
prophesied  of  old  concerning  these  words, 
through  Solomon,  in  his  nineteenth  Ode,  say- 
ing:

"  '  The  lord  is  above  my  head  as  it  were  a 
garland,  and  I  shall  never  be  without  it.  The 
garland    of    truth   hath  been    woven    for    me ;

(117)  and  he  hath  caused  its  branches  to 
flourish  in  me,  for  it  is  not  like  unto  -^^^^^^  ^.j^^ 
a  garland  that  withereth  and  flourish-  ZT^H^tt' 
eth  not.  Thy  branches  are  full  [of  ZlZJ.om

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard  these 
words   which    Mary,   his   mother,    had   '^^^'^^  com-

spoken,  that  he  said  unto  her:  "Well  tis mother, 
said  ;  it  is  well.  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  thee, 
they  shall  proclaim  thee  blessed  from  one  end  of 
the  earth  to  the  other,  for  the  covenant  of  the 
first  mystery  hath  dwelt  in  thee,  and  by  this 
covenant  shall  be  saved  all  worlds  and  all 
heights,  and  this  covenant  is  the  beginning  and 
the  end."
