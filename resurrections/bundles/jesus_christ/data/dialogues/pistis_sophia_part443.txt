"  The  fire,  the  water,  and  the  wine  are  for 
cleansing  all  the  sins  of  the  world  ;  the  blood 
I  had  as  a  sign  of  the  body  of  human  kind, 
and  I  received  it  in  the  region  of  Barbelo,  the 
great  power  of  the  divine  invisible  ;  while  the 
breath  draweth  all  souls  and  bringeth  them  unto 
the  region  of  light.

The  same  "  ^'^^   ^his  cause  have  I  said  unto

^a£ed^^     you,   '  I   am  come  to  cast  fire  on  the

fire.

"  For  this  cause  I  said  to  the  Samaritan 
woman,  '  If  thou  hadst  known  of  the  gift  of 
God,  and  who  hath  said  unto  thee,  "  Give  me 
to  drink,"  (374)  thou  wouldst  have  asked  him 
to  give  thee  living  water,  that  thou  mightest 
have  had  a  fountain  welling  up  in  thee  for  life 
eternal.'

"  For  this  cause,  also,  I  took  a  cup  of  wine, 
and  blessed  it,  and  gave  it  unto  you,  saying, 
'  This  is  the  blood  of  the  covenant  which  shall 
be  poured  out  for  you,  for  the  remission  of 
your  sins.'

"  For  this  cause,  also,  they  pierced  my  side 
with  a  spear,  and  there  came  forth  water  and 
blood.

"  These  are  the  mysteries  of  the  light  which 
remit  sins  ;  that  is  to  say,  these  are  the  appella-

light."

It  came  to  pass  after  this,  that  Jesus  gave 
Jesus  and  ^he  command,  "  Let  all  the  powers  of
