great  error,  because  the  operations  which  they 
were  accustomed  formerly  to  eflPect  in  their 
four  angles,  at  the  time  when  they  turned  to 
the  left,  and  in  their  three  angles,  and  in  their 
eight  configurations,  the  operations  in  which 
they  were  constant,  at  the  time  when  they 
turned  to  the  left — these  I  have  now  changed, 
and  I  have  caused  them  to  make  all  their  con- 
figurations turning  to  the  right  for  six  months, 
in  order  that  they  may  be  confused  in  all  their 
extent ;  (32)  on  the  other  hand,  I  have  made 
them  turn  to  the  left  for  six  months,  accom- 
plishing the  actions  of  their  influences  and  of 
all  their  configurations,  in  order  that  they  may 
be  thrown  into  confusion,  and  wander  in  error 
— the  rulers  who  are  in  the  seons,  in  their 
spheres,  in  their  heavens,  and  in  all  their 
regions,  so  that  they  may  not,  even  them- 
selves, understand  their  path."

It  came  to  pass,  that  when  Jesus  had  said 
these  words — Philip  was  sitting  writ-  Philip 
ing  all  the  words  that  Jesus  spake — it  Jesus. 
came  to  pass,  therefore,  after  this,  that  Philip 
drew  nigh,  bowed  himself,  and  worshipped  the 
feet  of  Jesus,  saying :  "  Master  and  saviour, 
grant  me  permission  to  speak  before  thee  and 
to  question  thee  on  this  word,  before  that  thou 
tellest  us  of  the  regions  whither  thou  didst  go 
for  thy  ministry."

32  PISTIS   SOPHIA.

The  saviour,  the  compassionate,  answered  and 
said  unto  Philip  :  "  Permission  is  given  thee  to 
speak  what  thou  wilt."
