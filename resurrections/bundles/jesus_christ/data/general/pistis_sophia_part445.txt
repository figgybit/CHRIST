"  Hear  me,  0  father,  father  of  all  fatherhood. 
(376)  I  invoke  you  also,  ye  who  remit  sins  and 
purify  iniquities.  Remit  the  sins  of  the  souls  of 
these  my  disciples  who  have  followed  me,  and 
purge  their  iniquities ;  make  them  fit  to  be 
reckoned  in  the  kingdom  of  my  father,  the 
father  of  the  treasure  of  light,  for  they  have 
followed  me  and  kept  my  commandments.

"  Now,  therefore,  0  father,  father  of  all  father-
