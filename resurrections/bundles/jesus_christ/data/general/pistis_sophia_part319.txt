before  the  mystery  and  the  symbol  of  the  king-

"  And  when  he  shall  have  been  brought  unto 
the  virgin  of  light,  the  virgin  of  light  will  see 
the  symbol  of  the  mystery  of  the  kingdom  of 
that  ineffable  which  shall  be  with  him ;  the

light  of  that  mystery,  that  is  to  say,  the  strict

excellent  seal,  which  is  this  ....  And  no

of  that  ineffable.
