shir)  of  ^^^  original  was  no  other  than  the  famous  Apoca- 
the  Greek  lypse  of  Sophia,  composed  by  Valentinus,  the  most 
origma  .  |g.^j,j;jg(j  doctor  of  the  Gnosis,  who  lived  for  thirty 
years  in  Egypt  in  the  latter  half  of  the  second  century,  and 
was  also  a  master  of  the  Greek  language,  in  which  he  wrote 
his  treatises.  But  the  farther  consideration  of  this  point 
must  be  postponed  for  the  Commentary  I  propose  to  write, 
and  in  which  a  compai'ison  between  the  Pistis  Sophia  and 
the  rest  of  the  fragments  of  the  writings  of  Valentinus 
which  have  come  down  to  us,  will  be  attempted.  It  is 
sufficient  to  state  here  that  this  view  is  supported  by 
AVoide,  Jablonski,  La  Croze,  Scholtze,  Dulaurier,  Schwartze, 
Renan,  Bevaillant,  Usener,  and  Amelineau,  the  last  of  whom, 
in  his  Essay  on  Egyptian  Gnosticism  and  in  the  introduction 
to  his  translation  of  the  Pistis  Sophia,  has  dealt  at  length 
with  the  matter.  The  guarded  opinion  of  Harnack  also 
allows  for  the  date  of  Valentinus.  In  his  essay  on  the 
subject  in  1891  (op.  inf.  cit,,  pp.  9.5  sq.),  the  famous  Biblical 
critic  gives  the  terminus  a  quo  as  140,  and  the  terminus 
ad  quern  as  302.     He  bases  the  earliest  limit  on  the  fact

INTRODUCTIOX.  XXXI

that  the  Gospels  and  Pauline  Epistles  are  regarded  in  the

text  as  Holy  Scripture,  and  even  a  passage  from  the  Ejnstle

to  the  Uomans  is  quoted  ])y  the  author  as  a  saying  of  Jesus

by  the   mouth  of  Paul.     Now,    the  Pauline  writings  were

never   spoken    of   as    Holy    Scripture    before    the    time    of

Antoninus  Pius  (138),     The  latest  limit  is  amved  at  by  the

passage  about  persecution  on  page  277,  which  leads  Harnack

to  conjecture  that  the  author  was  writing  at  a  time  when
