"  Now,  therefore,  when  the  workmen  have 
finished  the  man  entirel}^  and  have  set  all  these 
seals  on  his  body,  (349)  the  workmen  take  note 
of  the  peculiarity  [of  the  seals]  and  bring  it  unto 
the  receivers  of  wrath  who  preside  over  all  the 
punishments  of  the  judgments,  and  they  hand 
it  over  to  their  receivers  so  that  they  may  be 
able  to  take  the  souls  apportioned  to  them  out 
of  their  bodies  ;  [that  is  to  say]  those  to  whom 
the  peculiarity  of   the  seals   is  given   that  they

taken  out  of  body,  and  also  know  the  time  when 
the  body  shall  be  born,  so  as  to  send  their  work-

small  in  it,  and  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit 
being  small  in  it ;  whereas  the  destiny,  being 
vast,  is  not  mingled  with  the  body,  according  to 
the  regulation  of  the  three,  (350)  but  folio weth 
after  the  soul,  the  body,  and  the  counterfeit  of 
the  spirit,  until  the  soul  passeth  from  the  body 
according  to  the  type  of  death  whereby  he  shall 
die,  according  to  what  hath  been  decreed  unto 
him  by  the  rulers  of  the  great  fate.
