evil,  and  my  life  draweth  nigh  unto  hell.  I  am 
counted  among  them  that  go  down  into  the  pit. 
I  have  become  as  a  man  who  hath  no  help. 
Free  among  the  dead,  like  unto  the  wounded, 
stretched  out  and  sleeping  in  the  tombs,  of 
whom  thou,  in  truth,  thinkest  not,  and  who  have 
been  laid  low  by  thy  hands.  They  have  left  me 
in  a  pit  below,  in  darkness  and  in  the  shadow 
of  death.  Thy  wrath  is  hard  upon  me,  and  all 
thy  disquietude  hath  come  upon  me.  (Dia- 
psalma.)  Thou  hast  put  away  mine  acquaint- 
ance far  from  me  ;  they  have  looked  on  me  as 
an  abomination.  They  have  abandoned  me, 
and  I  cannot  get  forth.  My  eye  hath  become 
feeble  in  my  poverty,  and  I  have  cried  unto  thee, 
0  lord,  the  whole  day  long ;  I  have  stretched 
forth  my  hands  unto  thee.     Wilt  thou  not  show

thy  wonders  among  the  dead  ?  Shall  not  the 
physicians  arise  to  confess  thee  ?  Shall  they 
not  utter  thy  name  in  the  tombs ;  (73)  and  thy 
righteousness  in  a  land  which  thou  hast  for- 
gotten ?

"'But  as  for  me.  I  have  cried  unto  thee, 
0  lord,  and  my  prayer  shall  reach  thee  early 
in  the  morning ;  turn  not  thy  face  far  from 
me.  For,  as  for  me,  I  am  poor,  I  am  in  misery 
from  my  childhood.  When  I  exalted  myself,  I 
was  abased ;  but  I  have  risen  up  again.  Thy 
wrath  is  come  upon  me,  and  thy  fears  have 
troubled  me.  They  have  surrounded  me  like 
water,  they  have  seized  upon  me  the  whole  day 
long.  My  comrades  hast  thou  put  away  from 
me,  and  also  my  acquaintances,  in  my  misery.'

"  This  is  the  interpretation  of  the  mystery  of 
the  fifth  repentance,  recited  by  Pistis  Sophia, 
when  she  was  constrained  in  chaos."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had
