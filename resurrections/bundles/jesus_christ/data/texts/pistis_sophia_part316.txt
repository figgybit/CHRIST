"  In  like  manner,  also,  they  who  shall  have 
received  the  third  mystery  of  the  first  mystery, 
and  also  the  fourth,  the  fifth,  the  sixth,  up  to 
the  twelfth,  each  shall  be  king  over  all  the 
regions  of  the  saviour  of  which  he  shall  have 
received  the  mystery.  And  he  who  shall  have 
received,  after  the  others,  the  twelfth  mystery 
of  the  first  mystery,  that  is  to  say,  the  authentic 
mystery,  concerning  which  I  will  speak  with  you 
â€” (236)  he,  then,  who  shall  have  received  those 
twelve  mysteries  which  pertain  to  the  first  mys- 
tery, when  he  shall  depart  from  the  world,  shall 
pass  through  all  the  regions  of  the  rulers  and  all 
the  regions  of  the  light,  as  a  mighty  light-stream, 
and  he  also  shall  be  king  over  all  the  regions 
of  the  twelve  saviours.     [Such  souls,]  however,

shall  not  be  equal  to  them  who  shall  have  re- 
ceived this  one  mystery  of  that  ineffable.  But 
he  who  shall  have  received  this  mystery  shall 
dwell  in  those  orders,  in  that  they  are  excellent, 
and  he  shall  dwell  in  the  orders  of  the  twelve 
saviours."

speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples,    Mary  quos-

that  Mary  Magdalene  came  forward,  Jesus. 
and  kissed  the  feet  of  Jesus,  and  said  unto  him  : 
"  Master,  bear  with  me  and  be  not  wroth  with  me, 
if  I  question  thee ;  but  have  mercy  upon  us,  0 
Master,  and  reveal  unto  us  the  matter  on  which 
we  shall  question  thee.  Now,  therefore,  0 
Master,  how  is  it  that  the  first  mystery  hath 
twelve  mysteries,  whereas  that  ineffable  hath 
but  one  mystery  ?  "
