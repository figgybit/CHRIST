"Now,  therefore,  when  I  shall  have  finished 
explaining  the  whole  of  the  emanation,  I  will 
give  you  and  tell  you  the  great  mysteries  of  the 
three  inheritances  of  my  kingdom,  those  which 
are  chief  of  the  mysteries  which  I  will  give  you. 
I  will  tell  them  unto  you  in  all  their  configura- 
tions, in  all  their  types,  and  in  all  their  numbers, 
together  with  the  seals  of  the  third  space,  which 
is  the  first  space  from  the  exterior  ;  and  I  will 
tell  you  the  explanations,  apologies,  and  symbols 
of  that  space.

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  him : 
"  Ask  concerning  that  which  thou  desirest  to 
question  and  I  will  reveal  it  unto  thee  face  to
