the  Coptic  idiom,  as  may  be  seen  from  Amelineau's  Intro- 
duction to  his  French  version  (p.  x),  where  he  writes  : 
"  Whoever  has  any  knowledge  of  the  Coptic  language 
knows  that  this  idiom  is  foreign  to  long  sentences  ;  that 
it  is  a  tongue  eminently  analytic  and  by  no  means  syn- 
thetic ;  that  its  sentences  are  composed  of  small  clauses 
exceedingly  precise,  and  almost  independent  of  each  other. 
Of  course  all  Coptic  authors  are  not  equally  easy,  some  of 
them  are  even  exceedingly  difficult  to  understand  ;  but  this 
much  is  certain,  that  never  under  any  circumstances  in 
Coptic  do  we  come  across  those  j.eriods  with  complicated 
incidental  sentences,  of  three  or  four  different  clauses, 
whose  elements  are  synthetically  united  together  so  that 
the  sense  of  the  entire  sentence  cannot  be  grasped  before 
we  arrive  at  the  last  clause.  Nevertheless,  this  is  just 
what  the  reader  meets  with  in  this  work.  The  sentences 
are  so  entangled  with  incidental  and  complicated  propo- 
sitions, that  often,  indeed  very  often,  the  Coptic  translator 
has  lost  the  thread,  so  to  say,  and  made  main  propositions 
out  of  incidental  cla\xses,  so  that  we  find  the  continuation 
of  the  fii'st  proposition  three  or  four  pages  further  on. 
This  peculiarity  is  not  calculated  to  facilitate  the  trans- 
lation of  a  work,  the  ideas  in  which  are  in  themselves  very 
difficult  to  comprehend  ;  the  one  thing  that  it  conclusively 
proves  is  that  the  book  was  originally  written  in  a  learned 
language  ;  that  consequently  none  of  the  idioms  spoken  in 
the  Orient  could  have  been  the  original  language  in  which 
the  work  in  question  was  conceived  and  written  ;  that  we 
must  accordingly  choose  between  Greek  and  Latin  ;  that 
only  one  of  these  languages  at  this  peinod,  the  second 
century  [the  date  assigned  to  the  original  by  Amelineau] , 
is  at  all  likely  in  Egypt,  namely,  Greek."
