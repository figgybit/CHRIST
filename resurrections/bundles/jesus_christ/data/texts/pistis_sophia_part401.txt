"  And  if  that  soul  hath  exhausted  the  number 
of  the  cycles,  the  virgin  of  light  will  test  it,  but 
will  not  suffer  it  to  be  chastised,  although  it 
have  completed  the  number  of  its  cycles,  but 
will  hand  it  over  to  the  seven  virgins  of  light, 
and  the  seven  virgins  of  light  will  examine  that 
soul,  and  will  baptise  it  in  their  baptisms,  they 
will  give  it  the  spiritual  chrism,  and  will  bring 
it  into  the  treasure  of  light,  to  set  it  in  the 
last  order  of  the   light,  until    the  ascension  of

SECOND   BOOK.  329

the  whole  number  of  perfect  souls.  And  when 
they  shall  be  about  to  draw  aside  the  veils  of 
the  region  of  them  of  the  right,  they  shall  cleanse 
that  soul  anew  and  will  purify  it,  they  will 
make  it  pure  so  as  to  set  it  in  the  orders  of  the 
first  saviour  in  the  treasure  of  light."

(329)  It  came  to  pass  when  the  saviour  had 
finished  speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples, 
that  Mary  answered  and  said  unto  Jesus : 
"  Master,  I  have  heard  thee  say,  '  He  who  shall 
receive  the  mysteries  of  that  ineffable  or  who 
shall  receive  the  mysteries  of  the  first  mysteries, 
they  will  become  flames  of  light,  or  streams  of 
light,  that  they  may  pass  through  all  the  regions 
until  they  come  into  the  region  of  the  inherit- 
ance.

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  When  they  shall  have  received  the  y^-^^ 
mystery  during  their  lifetime,  and  streams. 
have  passed  from  the  body,  they  will  become 
flames  of  light  and  streams  of  light,  that  they 
may  pass  through  every  region  until  they  enter 
the  region  of  the  inheritance.
