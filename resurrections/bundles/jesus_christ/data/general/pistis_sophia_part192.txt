trusted  in  the  light  which  is  in  the  height. 
They  have  opened  their  mouth  against  me, 
saying,  "  Yea,  we  will  take  from  her  her  light." 
Now,  therefore.  0  light,  thou  knowest  their 
guile ;  suffer  them  not,  and  let  not  thy  help  be 
far  from  me.  Haste  thee,  0  light,  bring  about 
my  retribution  and  my  vindication,  and  judge 
me  in  thy  goodness.  Now,  therefore,  0  light 
of  lights,  let  them  not  take  away  my  light,  and 
let  them  not  say  among  themselves,  "  Our  power 
is  glutted  with  her  light."  Let  them  not  say, 
"  We  have  devoured  her  power."  But  let  dark- 
ness fall  upon  them,  let  them  that  desire  to  take 
away  my  light,  become  without  power  ;  let  them 
be  clothed  with  chaos  and  darkness,  who  say, 
"We  will  take  away  her  light  and  her  power." 
Now,  therefore,  save  me  that  I  may  rejoice,  for 
I  long  for  the  thirteenth  aeon,  the  place  of 
righteousness,  and  I  shall  say  for  ever,  (93) 
"  May  the  light  of  thy  messenger  leou  shine 
more  and  more,"  and  my  tongue  shall  sing  a 
song  in  thy  gnosis  all  my  time  in  the  thirteenth 
^on.'"

And  when  Jesus  had  said  these  words  unto 
his  disciples,  he  said  unto  them :  "  Let  him 
who  is  sober  among  you,  utter  their  interpreta- 
tion."

And  James  came  forward,  and  kissed  the 
breast  of  Jesus,  and   said:   ''Master,  my  spirit

their  interpretation.  For  this  cause  also  thy 
power  hath  prophesied  of  old,  through  David, 
in  the  thirt57'-fourth  Psalm,  saying  concerning 
the  ninth  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia  :
