vailed  against  me.  But  when  thou  hadst  hum- 
bled me,  they  pursued  the  more  after  me,  and 
their  emanations  added  pains  to  my  humiliation  ; 
they  took  from  me  of  my  light-power,  and  began 
again  to  be  hostile  to  me ;  they  have  constrained 
me  mightily  to  take  away  all  the  light  which 
was  in  me.  Because,  therefore,  of  the  evils  in 
which  they  have  planted  me,  suffer  them  not 
to  enter  into  the  thirteenth  aeon,  the  region  of 
righteousness.  Let  them  not  be  reckoned  in 
the  number  of  those  whose  light  is  purified, 
let  them  not  be  reckoned  in  the  number 
of  those  who  will  quickly  repent,  that  they 
may  speedily  receive  the  mystery  in  the  light ; 
for  they  have  taken  my  light  from  me. 
My  power  hath  begun  to  cease  in  me,  and 
I  am  destitute  of  my  light.

"  '  Now,  therefore,  0  light — [light]  which  is 
with  thee  and  is  [also]  with  me — I  sing  thy  name 
in  glory.  May  my  song  please  thee,  0  light, 
as  an  excellent  mystery,  which  leadeth  to  the 
interior  of  the  gates  of  light,  and  of  which  they 
will  tell  who  shall  repent,  and  whose  light  shall 
be  purified.  Now,  therefore,  let  all  matter  rejoice. 
(52)  Seek  ye  all  the  light,  that  the  power  of 
the  stars  which  is  in  us  may  be  revealed,  for 
the  light  hath  heard  the  matters,  nor  will  it  leave 
any  without  purging  them.  Let  all  souls  and 
matters  praise  the  lord  of  all  the  seons,  and  all
