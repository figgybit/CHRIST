"  After  that,  they  take  it  unto  the  virgin  of 
light,  who  judgeth  the  righteous  and  sinners, 
that  she  may  judge  it,  and,  when  the  sphere 
turneth,  hand  it  over  to  her  receivers,  who  will 
cast  it  into  the  Â£eons  of  the  sphere,  and  the 
workmen  of  the  sphere  will  carry  it  into  the 
lake  below  the  sphere,  so  that  this  [lake] 
becometh  a  seething  fire  and  eateth  into  it  until 
it  hath  mightily  purified  it.

"And  then  laluham,  the  receiver  of  Sabaoth 
Adamas,  bringeth  a  draught  of  oblivion,  that  it 
may  drink  it  and  forget  every  place  and  every 
region  through  which  it  hath  passed,  so  that  it 
may  be  put  into  another  body  which  shall  pass 
all  its  time  in  afiliction.

"  This  is  the  punishment  of  the  slanderer." 
Mary  said  :  "  Woe,  w^oe,  unto  sinners  !  " 
And  Salome  spake  and  said  :  "  Jesus, 
Master,  [in  the  case  of]  a  murderer,  who  hath 
committed  no  other  sin  but  that  of  murder,  when 
he  shall  pass  from  the  body,  what  w411  be  his 
punishment  ? "

Jesus  answered  and  said  :  (382)  "  [In  the 
case  of]  a  murderer,  who  hath  commit-  Thepunish- 
ted  no  other  sin  but  that  of  murder,  murderer, 
when  the  time  is  fulfilled  by  the  sphere  for  him 
to  pass  out  of  the  body,  the  receivers  of  lalda- 
baoth  come  to  lead  his  soul  out  of  the  body, 
and  bind  it  by  the  feet  to  a  great  daemon  with 
the  face  of  a  horse,  to  gallop  round  with  it  three 
days  in  the  world.

"  And  then  it  is  carried  into  the  regions  of 
ice  and  snow,  to  be  there  chastised  for  three 
years  and  six  months,

"  And  then  it  is  brought  into  chaos  unto 
laldabaoth  and  his  forty  and  nine  daemons,  that 
each  of  his  daemons  may  scourge  it  for  another 
three  years  and  six  months.
