to  another,  together — for  my  light  had  aban- 
doned me — "  Seize  her,  take  from  her  all  the 
light  which  is  in  her."  Therefore,  0  light,  go 
not  far  from  me ;  save  me,  0  light,  save  me 
from  the  hands  of  these  pitiless  ones.  Let  them 
that  would  take  away  my  power  fall,  and  be 
without  strength.  Let  them  that  would  take 
away  my  light-power  be  clothed  with  darkness, 
and  let  them  be  impotent.'

"  This  is  the  second  repentance  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  singing  a  song  to  the  light."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples,  that  he 
said  unto  them :  "  Do  ye  understand  how  I 
speak  unto  you  ?  "

And  Peter  starting  forward,  said  unto  Jesus  : 
"  Master,  we  cannot  endure  this  woman   _

suffer   us   to    speak,    but    she    speaks 
many  times."

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  his  dis- 
ciples :  "  Let  him  in  whom  the  power  of  his 
spirit  seethes,  to  make  him  understand  what  I 
say,  let  him  come  forward  and  speak.  (58)  But 
as  for  thee,  Peter,  I  see  that  thy  power  in  thee 
understandeth  the  interpretation  of  the  mystery 
of  the  repentance  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake. 
Now,  therefore,  Peter,  expound  the  meaning  of 
her  repentance  in  the  midst  of  thy  brethren."
