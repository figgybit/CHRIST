sisted  in  congress  and  procreated  rulers,  and  arch- 
angels, and  angels,  and  workmen  and  decans.  [So] 
leou,  the  father  of  my  father,  came  forth  from  the 
right,  and  bound  them  to  the  fate  of  the  sphere.

"  For  there  are  twelve  £eons,  Sabaoth  Adamas 
ruling  over  six  of  them  and  his  brother  labraoth 
ruling  over  the  remaining  six.  But  labraoth  and 
his  rulers  have  believed  in  the  mysteries  of  the 
light,  and  practising  the  mysteries  of  the  light 
they  have  abandoned  the  mystery  of  congress. 
Whereas  Sabaoth  Adamas  and  his  riders  have 
continued  to  practise  [the  mystery  of]  congress.

"  And  when  leou,  the  father  of  my  father,  saw 
that  labraoth  had  believed,  he  took  him  up  with 
all  the  rulers  that  had  believed  with  him.  Re- 
ceiving [his  soul]  in  the  sphere,  he  brought  him 
unto  a  pure  atmosphere,  near  the  light  of  the 
sun,  betw^een  the  regions  of  them  of  the  midst 
and  the  regions  of  the  invisible  god.  Thus  he 
set  him  with  the  rulers  that  had  believed.
