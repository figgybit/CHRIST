*'  And,  again,  as  to  the  utterance  of  thy 
power,  '  They  have  given  them  a  draught  from 
on  high ' ;  that  is,  the  light  hath  been  given 
unto  them  by  the  light-stream  '  which  came 
forth  from  myself,  [who  am]  the  first  mys- 
tery.'

"  And  as  to  the  saying  of  thy  power,  '  Blessed 
are  the  ministers  of  that  draught,'  that  is  the 
word  which  thou  hast  spoken,  '  Gabriel  and 
Michael,  they  who  were  in  attendance,  led  the 
stream  into  chaos  and  also  brought  it  forth 
again.'  The  mysteries  of  light  which  had  been 
entrusted  to  the  light- stream  will  be  given  unto 
them.

"  And  as  to  the  further  utterance  of  thy 
power,  '  They  have  refreshed  the  parched  lips ' ; 
that  is,  Gabriel  and  Michael  have  taken  nothing 
for  themselves  from  the  light-powers  of  Pistis 
Sophia,   [the  powers]  which   they  had  wrested

from   the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  but  infused 
them  into  Pistis  Sophia.

"And  again  the  word  which  it  spake,  'They 
who  were  fainting,  have  felt  their  heart  rejoice ' ; 
that  is,  all  the  other  powers  of  Pistis  Sophia, 
which  had  not  been  taken  away  by  the  emana- 
tions of  Arrogant,  rejoiced  greatly  ;  they  were 
filled  with  light  by  their  light-fellows,  for  they 
were  infused  into  them.

"And  the  word  which  thy  power  again  uttered, 
(134)  'They  have  revived  the  souls  which  were 
breathing  their  last,  that  they  might  not  die ' ; 
that  is,  when  they  had  poured  their  light 
into  Pistis  Sophia,  they  vivified  her  material 
body  from  which  the  light  had  previously 
been  taken,  but  which  was  not  destined  to 
perish.
