It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had 
heard  the  words  which  Mary  said,  that  he  under- 
stood that  the  disciples  had  heard,  but  that  they 
were  beginning  to  lose  courage.  Therefore,  he- 
encouraged  them,  saying :  "  Grieve  not,  my 
disciples,  concerning  the  mystery  of  that  ineffable,, 
thinking  that  ye  will  not  understand  it.  Amen, 
I  say  unto  you,  that  mystery  is  yours,  and  every 
one's  who  shall  give  ear  unto  you,  and  shall 
renounce  the  whole  of  this  world,  and  all  the 
matter  therein,  who  shall  renounce  all  the  evil 
thoughts  that  are  therein,  and  shall  renounce  all 
the  cares  of  this  aeon.

(218)  "  Now,  therefore,  will  I  tell  you  :  Whoso- 
jesus  ex-  ever  shall  renounce  the  whole  world 
that  that      and  all  therein,  and  shall  submit  him-

mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of  light ;  it  is  far 
simpler  to  understand  than  all  the  rest,  and  it  is 
far  clearer  than  them  all.  He  who  shall  arrive 
at  a  knowledge  of  that  mystery,  hath  renounced 
the  whole  of  this  world  and  all  its  cares.  For 
this  cause  have  I  said  to  you  aforetime,  '  Come 
unto  me  all  ye  that  are  oppressed  with  cares  and 
labour  under  their  weight,  and  I  will  give  you 
rest,  for  my  burden  is  light  and  my  yoke  easy.' 
Now,  therefore,  he  who  shall  receive  that  mystery, 
hath  renounced  the  whole  world,  and  all  the 
material  cares  that  are  therein.
