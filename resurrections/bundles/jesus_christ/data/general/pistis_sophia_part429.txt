boundless  [spaces],  hear  me  because  of  my  dis- 
ciples whom  I  have  brought  into  thy  presence, 
that  they  may  believe  in  all  the  words  of  thy 
truth  ;  grant  unto  them  all  things  for  which  I 
have  cried  unto  thee,  for  1  know  the  name  of 
the  father  of  the  treasure  of  light,"

Yet  again  did  Jesus,  that  is  to  say  Aber- 
amentho,  cry  aloud,  invoking  the  ^g  com- 
name  of  the  father  of  the  treasure  of  ^e^velis  of 
light,  and  saying:  "Let  all  the  £t'3 
mysteries  of  the  rulers,  authorities,  '^^^"^"• 
angels,  archangels,  and  all  the  powers  and  all 
the  works  of  the  invisible  gods,  (359)  Agram- 
machamareg  and  Barbelo  Bdelle,  withdraw  them- 
selves, and  roll  themselves  on  to  the  right."

And  in  that  hour  all  the  heavens  moved  to  the 
west ;  all  the  aeons,  the  spheres  and  their  rulers

and  all  their  powers  sped  to  the  west  to  the  left

And  the  disk  of  the  sun  was  a  vast  dras^on

of  the  disk

of  the  sun.  qj^  seven  powers  of  the  left,  drawn  by 
four  powers  which  bore  the  likeuess  of  white 
horses.

But  the  car  of  the  moon  was  like  a  ship, 
The  figure  whose  helms  were  a  male  dragon  and  a 
of  the  ^^^^  female  dragon,  drawn  by  two  white 
™°°'^"  oxen.      The  fioure   of  a  babe   was   on

the  poop  steering  the  dragons  who  seized  the 
light  from  the  rulers ;  and  at  the  prow  was  the 
face  of  a  cat.

And  the  whole  world,  with  its  mountains  and 
seas,  sped  to  the  west  to  the  left.

And  Jesus  and  his  disciples  remained  in  the
