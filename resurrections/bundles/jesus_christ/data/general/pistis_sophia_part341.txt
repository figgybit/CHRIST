heavens,  and  hath  renounced  the  whole  world 
and  all  the  matter  therein,  and  we  should  give 
him  the  first  of  the  mysteries  of  light  which  are 
in  the  first  space  from  the  exterior,  and  if  a 
short  time  after  he  have  received  the  mysteries, 
he  should  return  to  his  transgression,  and  yet 
once  again  should  repent  and  cease  from  all  sin, 
(264)  and  should  renounce  the  whole  world  and 
all  the  matter  therein,  and  if  he  should  come 
[unto  us],  and  be  in  great  contrition,  and  if  we 
should  know  really  in  truth  that  God  willeth  that 
we  should  give  unto  him  the  second  mystery  of 
the  first  space  from  the  exterior ;  should  he 
moreover  in  like  manner  turn  again  and  trans- 
gress, and  be  in  the  sins  of  the  world,  and  yet 
once  more  again  repent  and  cease  from  the  sins 
of  the  world,  and  again  renounce  the  whole 
world  and  all  the  matter  therein,  and  be  in  great 
contrition,  and  we  should  know  it  with  certainty, 
and  he  is  not  a  hypocrite,  and  we  should  again 
give  him  the  mysteries  of  the  first  [space] ; 
should  he  further,  moreover,  in  like  manner, 
turn  again,  and  commit  sin,  and  plunge  into 
every  type  [of  sin],  wilt  thou  or  not  that  we 
remit  [his  transgressions]  unto  seven  times,  and 
give  him  the  mysteries  which  are  in  the  first 
space  from  the  exterior  unto  seven  times  ?  "

The  saviour   answered  again  and    said   unto 
John  :   "  Remit  ye  his  sin  not  only  unto  seven
