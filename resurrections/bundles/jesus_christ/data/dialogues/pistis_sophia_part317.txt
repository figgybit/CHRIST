Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  her  :  "  Indeed, 
it  hath  but  one  mystery  ;  yet  that  of  the  three 
mystery  maketh  three  mysteries,  al-  ^H^e^ 
though  it  is  only  one  mystery ;  but  ™y^^^"®^- 
the  type  of  each  of  them  is  different.  It  also 
maketh  five  mysteries,  while  still  remaining  one  ; 
but  the  type  of  each  is  different,  so  that  these 
five  mysteries  are  equal  to  one  another  (237) 
in  the  mystery  of  kingship  in  the  inheritance  of 
light,  but  the  type  of  each  of  them  is  different, 
and  their  kingdom  is  higher  and  more  exalted

mysteries  of  the  first  mystery ;  but  they  are 
not  equal  in  the  kingdom  of  the  one  and  only 
mystery  of  the  first  mystery  in  the  kingdom  of 
light.

"  In  like  manner,  also,  the  three  mysteries 
are  not  equal  in  the  kingdom  which  is  in  the 
light,  but  the  type  of  each  of  them  is  diff"erent, 
and  they  also  are  not  equal  in  the  kingdom  of 
that  one  and  only  mystery  of  the  first  mystery 
in  the  kingdom  of  light.

"  Different,  moreover,  is  the  type  of  each  of 
these  three ;  and  the  types  of  the  configuration 
of  each  of  them  are  diff"erent  from  one  another.
