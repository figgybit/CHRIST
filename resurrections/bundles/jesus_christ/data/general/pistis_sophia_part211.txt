not  prevail  against  her.  And  when  it  had 
made  a  crown  of  light  on  her  head,  all  the  matters 
which  were  in  her  were  shaken,  and  were  all 
purified  in  her.  They  perished  and  remained 
in  chaos,  while  the  emanations  of  Arrogant 
gazed  upon  them  and  rejoiced.  iVnd  the  glories 
of  pure  light  which  were  in  Sophia,  added 
their  power  of  light  to  my  light-power,  which 
had  become  a  crown  upon  her  head.  It  came 
to  pass,  therefore,  again,  when  [my  light-power] 
surrounded  the  pure  light,  which  was  in 
Sophia,  and  her  pure  light  did  not  depart 
from  the  crown  of  power,  the  brilliant  Hame,  so 
that  the  emanations  of  Arrogant  should  rob  her 
of  it — when  this  was  done  unto  her,  the  power 
of  unmixed  light  which  was  in  Sophia  began  to 
sing  a  song.  And  she  sang  a  song  unto  my 
light-power  which  was  a  crown  unto  her  head^ 
and  she  sang  a  song,  saying :

"  '  0  light,  be  thou  a  crown  unto  my  head;  nor 
shall  I  ever  cause  it  to  depart,  so  that  gopi^ia 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant  may  as-  othtr^long' 
sail  me  ;  and  though  all  the  matters  be  °^  praise. 
shaken,  yet  shall  I  not  be  shaken.  (116) 
And  though  all  my  matters  be  lost,  and 
remain  in  chaos,  and  the  emanations  of  Ar- 
rogant gaze  upon  them,  yet  shall  I  not  perish, 
for  the  light  is  with  me,  and  I  am  with  the 
light.'
