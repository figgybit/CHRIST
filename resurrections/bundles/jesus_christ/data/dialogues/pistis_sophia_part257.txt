"Then     I     further     said     unto     her:     (167)

*  Hearken  that  I  may  tell  unto  thee  their  time, 
when  that  which  I  have  just  said  unto  thee 
shall  come  to  pass.  It  shall  come  to  pass  when 
three  times  shall  be  accomplished.'

"  Pistis  Sophia  answered  and  said  unto  me  :

*  0  light,  how  shall  I  know  that  three  times 
are  accomplished,  so  that  I  may  rejoice,  and  be 
in  gladness  in  that  my  time  shall  be  nigh  for 
thee  to  bring  me  into  my  region "?  Moreover, 
I  shall  rejoice  when  thou  shalt  take  the  light- 
power  from  all  them  that  hated  me,  for  I  have 
trusted  in  thy  light.'

"  And  I  answered  and  said  unto  her  :  '  When 
thou  shalt  see  the  gate  of  the  treasure   g^^ 
of  the  great  light — it  openeth  in  the   fhau  know 
thirteenth  aeon,   and  is  to  the  left —   Jj5JeS\er 
when  this  gate  shall  be  opened,  then   i^Jgrance 
will  the  three  times  be  accomplished.'    i^ath  come.

168  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

"  Pistis  Sophia  continued  and  said  :  '  0  light, 
how  shall  I  know  in  this  region,  that  that  gate 
is  opened  ? '
