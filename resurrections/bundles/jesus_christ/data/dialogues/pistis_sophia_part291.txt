It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples,  that 
John  came  forward,  and  said  unto  Jesus  :  "  My 
Master  and  saviour,  give  me  also  commandment 
to  speak  in  thy  presence,  and  be  not  wroth  with 
me  if  I  question  thee  on  every  matter  with 
earnestness  and  confidence ;  for,  0  Master,  thou 
hast   promised   to    reveal    unto    us   all   that   we

should  ask.  Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  hide 
nothinor  from  us  at  all  of  that  on  which  we 
question  thee."

And  Jesus  answered  with  great  compassion, 
and  said  unto  John  :  ''To  thee,  also,  0  blessed 
John,  the  well -beloved,  I  give  commandment 
to  speak  the  word  which  thou  desirest,  and  I 
will  reveal  it  unto  thee  face  to  face,  without 
parable,  and  I  will  tell  thee  all  that  thou  askest 
me  with  earnestness  and  certainty."

And  John  answered  and  said  unto  Jesus :

entering  lower  orders  ?  "

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  John : 
"  Well,  indeed,  do  ye  question  on  every  matter 
with  earnestness  and  confidence  ;  now,  therefore, 
John,  hearken  while  I  speak  unto  thee.  Who- 
soever shall  have  received  the  mystery  of  the 
light,  every  one  will  remain  in  the  region  where 
he  shall  have  received  the  mystery,  and  will 
not  have  the  power  of  going  into  the  heights, 
into  the  higher  orders.
