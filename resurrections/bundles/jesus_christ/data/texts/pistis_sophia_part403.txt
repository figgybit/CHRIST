SECOND    BOOK.  331

them  ;  [supposing]  such  a  man  passeth  out  of 
the  body  without  again  repenting,  and  without 
again  receiving  the  mysteries  in  the  mysteries 
which  are  within  the  mysteries  which  he  hath 
previously  received,  [the  mysteries]  which  are 
received  again  when  a  man  repenteth  in  order  that 
his  sins  may  be  remitted  ;  (331)  when  [then]  such 
a  man  passeth  out  of  the  body,  and^we  know  for 
certain  that  he  hath  been  cast  into  the  belly  of 
the  dragon  of  outer  darkness  because  of  the  sins 
he  hath  committed,  and  he  hath  no  help  in  the 
world,  nor  any  one  who  in  compassion  may  cele- 
brate the  mystery  of  that  ineffable,  to  have  him 
taken  out  of  the  belly  of  the  dragon  of  outer 
darkness,  and  bring  him  unto  the  kingdom  of 
light â€” now,  then,  0  Master,  what  shall  he  do  to 
be  saved  from  the  torments  of  the  dragon  of 
outer  darkness  ?  Abandon  him  not,  0  Master, 
for  he  hath  endured  pains  in  the  persecutions, 
and  because  of  the  godhead  in  which  he  hath 
been.

"  Now,  therefore,  0  saviour,  have  pity  upon 
me,  that  none  of  our  kin  may  be  of  such  a  kind  ; 
and  have  mercy  upon  all  the  souls  who  shall  be 
of  this  kind,  for  thou  art  the  key  that  openeth 
the  pleroma  and  shutteth  the  pleroma,  and 
thy  mystery  containeth  all.  Have  mercy  upon 
such  souls,  0  Master,  for  [even  though]  it  were 
only  for  one  day,  they  pronounced  the  mysteries,

and  really  believed  them  and  were  not  hypocrites. 
Yea,  Master,  grant  them  a  boon  in  thy  goodness, 
and  give  them  rest  in  thy  mercy."
