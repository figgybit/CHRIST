cried  for  help,  but  my  voice  ascended  not  in  the 
darkness.  And  I  have  gazed  into  the  height, 
that  the  Hght,  in  which  I  had  trusted,  might 
help  me ;  and  when  I  looked  into  the  height, 
I  saw  all  the  rulers  of  the  aeons  in  great  number, 
angered  against  me,  rejoicing  over  me,  although 
I  had  done  them  no  ill ;  but  they  hated  me 
without  a  cause.  And  when  the  emanations  of 
Arrogant  had  seen  the  rulers  of  the  aeons  rejoic- 
ing over  me,  they  knew  that  the  rulers  of  the 
seons  would  not  aid  me  ;  they  took  courage,  those 
emanations  which  constrained  me  with  violence, 
and  the  light  which  I  had  not  taken  from  them, 
they  took  from  me.  Now,  therefore,  0  light  of

things  in  my  foolishness,  believing  that  this 
lion-faced  light-power  belonged  unto  thee  ;  and 
the  sin  which  I  have  done  is  clear  in  thy  sight. 
Suffer  me  no  more  to  be  weakened,  0  lord,  for 
I  have  trusted  in  thy  light  from  the  beginning. 
0  lord,  light  of  powers,  suffer  me  no  more  to 
lack  my  light,  for  it  is  because  of  thy  induce- 
ment and  light  that  I  am  in  this  agony,  and 
shame  hath  covered  my  face.  (49)  And  because 
of  thy  light,  I  am  a  stranger  to  my  brethren, 
the  invisibles,  and  also  to  the  great  emanations 
of  Barbelo.  These  things  have  befallen  me,  0 
light,  because  I  have  ardently  longed  for  thy 
dwelling  ;    and  the  wrath  of  Arrogant  is  fallen
