are  the  purgations  of  all  of  them.  And  ye  have

in  your  pourings  into  different  bodies  of  this

which  came  from  yourselves,  ye  have  struggled 
and  fought,  renouncing  the  whole  world  and  all 
the  matter  that  is  in  it ;  and  ye  have  not  held  your 
hands  in  the  fight,  until  ye  found  all  the  mys-
