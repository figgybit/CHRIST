save  the  whole  world,  and  that  ye  may  be  able 
to  bear  the  threat  of  the  rulers  of  the  world, 
and  the  calamities  of  the  world,  and  their 
dangers,  and  all  the  persecutions  which  the 
rulers  of  the  height  must  bring  upon  you. 
Many  times  have  I  said  unto  you,  the  power  which 
is  in  you,  I  have  brought  it  from  the  twelve 
saviours  which  are  in  the  treasure  of  lio-ht.  For 
which  cause  I  said  unto  you  from  the  beginning 
that  ye  were  not  of  this  world.  And  I  also  am 
not  of  this  world,  for  all  men  who  are  of  this 
world  have  taken  their  soul  from  the  rulers  of 
the  8eons.  But  the  power  which  is  in  you  is 
from  me.  Ye  are  souls  which  pertain  to  the 
height,  which  I  have  brought  from  the  twelve 
saviours  of  the  treasure  of  light,  and  which  I 
have  received  as  a  share  of  my  power,  which  I 
received  from  the  beginning.  (12)  And  when 
I  set  forth  to  come  into  this  world,  I  passed 
through  the  midst  of  the  rulers  of  the  sphere  ; 
I  assumed  the  likeness  of  the  angel  Gabriel,  in 
order  that  the  rulers  of  the  seons  might  not 
recognise  me,  but  think  that  I  was  the  angel 
Gabriel.

"  It  came  to  pass,  when  I  had  passed  through 
the   midst  of  the  rulers  of  the  seons,    Qf  the  m- 
that  I  looked  down   on   the   world   of  ofTokiThe 
men,   by   order  of  the   first  mystery ;   ^^P^i^t. 
I  found  Elizabeth,  mother  of  John  the  Baptist,

before  she  had  conceived  him ;  I  cast  into  her  a 
power  which  I  had  received  from  the  hand  of 
the  little  lao,  the  good,  who  is  in  the  midst, 
that  he  might  preach  before  me  and  prepare  my 
way,  and  baptise  in  the  water  of  the  remission 
of  sins.  This  power,  then,  is  in  the  body  of 
John.
