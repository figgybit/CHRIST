when  the  material  emanations  of  Arrogant  saw- 
that  I  had  conducted  her  into  a  region  slightly- 
less  confined  in  chaos,  they  ceased  for  a  time  to 
constrain  her,  thinking  that  she  would  be  taken 
out  of  chaos  entirely.  Now,  when  this  was 
done,  Pistis  Sophia  knew  not  that  it  was  I  who 
was  bringing  her  help,  and  she  did  not  recognise 
me  at  all,  but  she  continued  singing  a  song  to 
the  light  of  the  treasure,  which  she  had  seen  of 
old,  and  in  which  she  had  trusted,  thinking  that 
it  was  the  light  of  truth,  and  that  it  was 
because  she  had  trusted  in  the  light  which 
belongeth  to  the  truth  of  the  treasure,  that  there- 
fore she  had  been  taken  up  in  the  chaos,  and 
her  repentance  would  be  accepted.  But  the 
commandment  of  the  first  mystery  was  not  yet 
fulfilled  for  her  repentance  to  be  accepted.

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the  emanations 
of  Arrogant  discovered  that  Pistis  Sophia  had 
not  been  taken  out  of  chaos,  they  returned  all 
together    constraining    her   exceedingly.       And,

therefore,  she  uttered  her  eighth  repentance,  in 
that  they  had  ceased  to  constrain  her,  and  that 
they  had  returned,  and  again  constrained  her 
mightily.  And  she  spake  this  repentance, 
saying  :
