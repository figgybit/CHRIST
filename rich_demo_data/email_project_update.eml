Sarah,

I've made significant progress on the consciousness capture system!

The vector embeddings are now working with semantic search, meaning we can find
conceptually related memories even when they don't share keywords. For example,
searching for "happiness" now finds entries about joy, contentment, and even
peaceful meditation sessions.

The encryption layer is complete - using AES-256-GCM with consent-based access
levels. This ensures privacy while maintaining searchability.

Next steps:
- Integrate GPT-4 for the RAG system
- Add support for image memories
- Build the timeline visualization

This could revolutionize how we preserve human experience!

Best,
John
