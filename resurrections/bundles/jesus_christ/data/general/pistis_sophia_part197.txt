"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  on  my  entering 
into  chaos  to  succour  her,  that  she  saw  me,  in- 
asmuch as  I  was  of  an  intellectual  (noeric)  nature, 
and  shone  exceedingly  ;  and  I  was  full  of  com- 
passion for  her,  for  I  w^as  not  arrogant  like  that 
lion -faced  power  which  had  taken  from  Sophia 
the  power  of  her  light,  and  which  still  constrained 
her  to  take  from  her  the  wdiole  light  which  was 
in  her.  Sophia,  therefore,  saw  me  shining  more 
brightly  than  that  power,  tens  of  thousands  of 
times  ;  [she  saw  that  I  was]  full  of  compassion 
for  her,  (100)  and  she  knew  that  I  had  come 
forth  from  the  height  of  the  heights,  from  him 
in  whose  light  she  had  trusted  from  the  begin- 
ning. Pistis  Sophia,  therefore,  took  con- 
fidence, and  uttered  her  tenth  repentance, 
saying  :

98  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

"  '  I  have  cried  unto  thee,  0  light  of  lights  ; 
The  tenth     save  my  power  from   the   lips  of  the

repentance  .    ,     '  ,       .         .  -i      o

of  Sophia,  unrighteous  and  impious,  and  irom 
the  snares  of  guile.  0  light,  that  which  they 
would  have  taken  from  me  by  perfidious  snares, 
they  would  not  have  brought  unto  thee ;  for 
the  snares  of  Arrogant  are  scattered  about,  and 
so  are  the  traps  of  these  merciless  ones.  Woe 
is  me,  for  my  dwelling  is  far  off,  and  I  am  in 
the  habitations  of  chaos.  My  power  is  in  regions 
which  are  not  mine,  and  I  ha\'e  entreated  them 
that  are  without  pity  ;  and  when  I  entreated 
them,  they  fought  against  me  without  a  cause.'  "

And  when  Jesus  had  spoken  these  things  unto 
his  disciples,  he  said  unto  them  :  "  Now,  there- 
fore, let  him  whose  spirit  urgeth  him,  come 
forward,  and  utter  the  interpretation  of  this 
tenth  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia."
