to  yourselves  friends  of  the  mammon  former 
of  iniquity,  (335)  that  when  ye  are  '''^"'^â€¢ 
abandoned,  it  may  bring  you  into  everlasting 
habitations.'  What,  then,  is  the  mammon  of 
iniquity,  if  not  the  dragon  of  outer  darkness  ? 
That  is  to  say,  whosoever  shall  understand  the 
mystery  of  one  of  the  names  of  the  dragons  of 
outer  darkness,  if  he  is  abandoned  in  the  outer 
darkness,  or  if  he  hath  exhausted  the  cycles  of 
transmigration,  and  if  he  pronounceth  the  name 
of  the  dragon,  he  shal]  be  saved,  and  come  forth 
from  the  darkness,  and  receive  the  light  of  the 
treasure.     This  is  the  word,  0  Master."

The  saviour  answered  again  and  said  unto 
Mary  :  "  Well  said,  thou  pure  and  spiritual  one  ; 
that  is  the  interpretation  of  the  word."

Mary  continued  further  and  said  :  "  Master, 
doth  the  dragon  of  outer  darkness  come  into 
this  world  or  not  1 "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary : 
"When    the    light   of    the    outer   sun   P^*^^,^,

o  hght  of  the

shine  th,  it  hideth  the  darkness  of  the   sun  and  the

darkness  of

dragon ;  but  if  the  sun  is  below  this  ti^e  dragon. 
worM,  the  darkness  of  the  dragon  veileth  the 
sun  and  the  exhalation  of  the  darkness  entereth 
this  world  like  to  smoke  in  the  night ;  that  is  to

say,  that  were  the  sun  to  withdraw  its  rays,  it 
would  not  be  possible  for  the  world  to  endure 
the  darkness  of  the  dragon  in  its  true  form, 
without  being  dissolved  and  perishing."

(336)  And  when  the  saviour  had  spoken  these 
things,  Mary  continued  further  and  said  to  the 
saviour  :  "  Yet  further  do  I  question  thee ;  and 
hide  it  not  from  me.  Now,  therefoi-e,  0  Master, 
who  forceth  a  man  to  sin  1 "
