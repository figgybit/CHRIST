the  light-power  which  was  in  that  lion-faced 
power,  and  further  thou  didst  take  away  the 
power  of  all  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  and 
moreover  thou  didst  prevent  them  from  that 
hour  entering  their  own  region  from  chaos. 
Therefore  did  Pistis  Sophia  look  on  her  enemies  ; 
that  is  to  say,  the  emanations  of  Arrogant  just 
precisely  as  David  prophesied  concerning  her, 
saying,  '  But  thou  shalt  look  upon  them,  and 
thou  shalt  see  the  payment  of  the  sinners.'  Not 
only  did  she  look  upon  them  fallen  the  one  on 
the  other,  but  she  also  beheld  the  payment 
which  they  have  received.  Just  as  the  emana- 
tions of  Arrogant  thought  to  take  away  the 
light  which  was  in  Pistis  Sophia,  so  hast  thou 
recompensed  them ;  thou  hast  paid  them  their 
payment,  and  thou  hast  taken  the  light-power 
which  was  in  them,  instead  of  the  light  of  Sophia 
who  had  trusted  in  the  light  of  the  height.

"  And  as  thy  light-power  spake  through  David, 
'  Thou  hast  established  the  height  for  thyself 
as  a  place  of  refuge  ;  no  evil  shall  come  nigh 
thee,  no  plague  shall  enter  into  thy  house '  ; 
that  is  to  say,  when  Pistis  Sophia  trusted  in 
the  light,  and  when  she  was  in  peril,  she  sang 
unto  it  a  song,  and  the  emanations  of  Arrogant 
could  not  do  her  any  harm,  (147)  they  could 
not  injure  her,  they  could  not  at  all  come  nigh

her.
