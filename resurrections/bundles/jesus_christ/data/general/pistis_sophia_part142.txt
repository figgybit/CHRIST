great  forefathers,  their  imgenerated,  their  self- 
generated,  their  generated,  their  gods,  their 
sparks,  their  light-bearers,  in  a  word,  all  their 
great  ones,  saw  the  tyrants  of  their  region  with 
their  power  diminished  in  them,  and  become 
feeble ;  and  they  also  were  in  great  and  bound- 
less fear,  and  they  saw  the  mystery  of  their 
name  in  my  vesture,  and  they  strove  to  draw 
nigh  to  adore  the  mystery  of  their  name,  which 
was  in  my  vesture,  but  they  could  not  because 
of  the  great  light  that  was  with  me ;  but  they 
adored  a  little  removed  from  me,  they  wor- 
shipped the  light  of  my  vesture,  and  they  all 
cried  out  together,  singing  to  the  interior  of 
the  interiors.

"  It  came  to  pass,  when  this  was  done 
to  the  tyrants,  who  are  amid  the 
aeons,  that  they  lost  courage,  they  becomras-^ 
fell  down  in  their  seons,  and  became  *^^  ^^^^' 
as  the  men  of  the  world  who  are  dead,  who  have 
not  in  them  any  breath,  (42)  just  as  when 
I  took  from  them  their  power.  It  came 
to  pass,  therefore,  after  this,  when  I  had 
left  these  aeons,  that  every  one  of  those  who 
were  in  the  twelve  seons  was  bound  to  his  order, 
and  they  accomplished  their  works  as  it  had 
been  appointed  them ;  so  that  they  spent  six 
months  turning  to  the  left,  accomplishing  their 
actions  in  their  four  angles,  their  three  angles.

and  those  in  front  of  them,  and  that  they  spent 
also  six  months  facing  the  right,  [facing]  their 
three  angles,  their  four  angles,  and  those  in  front 
of  them.  This,  therefore,  will  be  the  path  of 
those  who  are  in  the  fate  and  in  the  sphere.
