M.D.     On  the  first  page  of  the  binding  is  the  following  note,

probably  in  Woide's  hand:  " Codex dialecti  Superioi'is  ^Egypti,

quam  Sahidicam    seu    Thebaidicam    vocant,    cujus    titulus

exstat  pagina  115  :  Pmeh  snaou  ntomos  fitpiste  Sophia â€”

Tomos  secundus  fidelis  Sapientite^Deest  pagina  337-344."

The  title  Piste  Sophia  is  incorrect ;  nowhere  is  this  form 
found  in  the  book,  and  the  suggested  emendation  of 
Dulaurier  and  Renan  from  Pistis  Sophia  to  Piste  Sophia 
"  La  fidele  Sagesse,"  has  received  no  support  from  other 
scholars.

Where  Askew  found  it  or  bought  it,  I  cannot  discover. 
It   is   not   mentioned    in   his    biography,  and  the  reference

XXVI  INTRODrCTION.
