"And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
*  Thou  hast  taken  dead  bones  and  hast  clothed 
them  with  a  body,  and  to  them  that  stirred  not 
thou  hast  given  the  energy  of  life  ' ;  this  is  the 
word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  And  thou 
hast  taken  all  my  powers  which  had  no  light 
in  them,   and  hast  infused   into    them    a  pure

light,  and  unto  all  my  limbs  which  had  no  light 
in  them,  thou  hast  given  a  living  light  from  on

high.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thy  way  is  void  of  destruction,  and  so  also 
thy  countenance '  ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  Thou  hast  made  straight  thy 
way  for  me  and  the  light  of  thy  countenance  ; 
they  have  been  a  way  void  of  destruction  unto 
me.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
*  Thou  hast  led  thine  aeon  into  destruction,  that 
all  might  be  destroyed  and  be  again  renewed ' ; 
this  is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  Thou 
hast  brought  me,  thy  power,  into  chaos  and 
destruction,  that  all  the  matters  which  were  in 
that  region  might  be  dissolved,  and  all  my 
power  be  renewed  in  the  light.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  And  thy  light  hath  become  a  foundation  for 
them  all '  ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia 
spake,  (160)  'And  thy  light  hath  been  in  them  all.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  light-power  uttered 
through  Solomon,  '  Thou  hast  poured  out  thy 
wealth  upon  him,  and  he  hath  become  a  place 
of  holy  habitation ' ;  this  is  the  word  which 
Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  Thou  hast  concentrated 
the  light  of  thy  stream  upon  me,  and  I  have 
become  a  pure  light-power.'

"  This,  then,  my  Master,  is  the  interpretation 
of  the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake."
