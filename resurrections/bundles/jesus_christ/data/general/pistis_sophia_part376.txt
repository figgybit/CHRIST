"  And  the  word  which  thou  spakest,  'I  am  come 
to  cast  fire  on  the  earth,  and  how  can  I  not  will 
that  it  should  burn  ? '  that  is  to  say,  0  Master,  that 
thou  hast  brought  the  mysteries  of  the  baptisms 
into  the  world,  and  how  canst  thou  not  will  that 
it  should  burn  up  all  the  sins  of  the  soul,  and 
purify  them  ?  And  afterwards  thou  didst  explain 
it  openly  saying,  '  I  have  a  baptism  with  which 
to  baptise,  (302)  and  how  shall  I  endure  until  it 
be  perfected  ? ' — that  is  to  say,  thou  shalt  not 
remain  in  the  world  until  the  baptisms  are 
perfected  and  have  made  the  souls  perfect.

"  And  again  the  word  which  thou  didst  speak 
unto  us  aforetime,  '  Think  ye  that  I  am  come  to 
bring  union  on  the  earth  ?  Nay,  but  I  am  come 
to  bring  separation ;  for,  from  this  hour,  five 
shall  be  in  one  house,  three  shall  be  separated 
against  two,  and  two  against  three ' ;  that  is  to 
say,  that  the  mystery  of  the  baptisms  which  thou

hast  brought  into  the  world,  hath  brought  about 
a  division  in  the  body  of  the  world,  for  it  hath 
separated  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit,  the  body 
and  the  destiny  into  one  group,  and  the  soul 
with  the  power  it  hath  separated  into  another ; 
that  is  to  say,  that  three  shall  be  against  two 
and  two  against  three."

When  Mary  had  spoken  these  words,  the  saviour 
said  :  "  Well  said,  O  Mary,  the  spiritual  one  of  pure 
light,  that  is  the  interpretation  of  the  word."

And  Mary  answered  again  and  said  :  "  Master,
