"  '  I  will  confess  thee,  0  light,  for  thou  hast 
preserved  me,  and  thy  wonderful  works  in  the 
race  of  men.  When  I  had  need  of  my  power, 
thou  didst  give  my  power  unto  me  ;  and  when  I 
had  need  of  my  light,  thou  didst  fill  me  with 
pure  light.  I  have  been  in  the  darkness  and 
the  shadow  of  chaos,  bound  in  the  hard  bonds 
of  chaos,  without  light  in  me,  for  I  had  pro- 
voked the  statute  of  light ;  I  had  transgressed,  I 
had  made  wroth  the  statute  of  light,  because  I 
had  come  forth  from  my  own  region.  (178) 
And  when  I  had  descended,  I  was  destitute  of 
my  light,  and  became  without  light,  and  there 
was  no  one  to  rescue  me.  And  when  they  con- 
strained me,  I  cried  out  unto  the  light,  and  it 
preserved  me  from  all  my  afflictions.  It  also 
broke  asunder  all  my  bonds,  and  brought  me 
forth  from  darkness  and  the  anguish  of  chaos.

SECOND   BOOK.  179

" '  I  will  confess  thee,  then,  0  light,  for  thou 
hast  preserved  me,  and  thy  wonders  have  been 
wrought  in  the  race  of  men  ;  thou  hast  shattered 
the  proud  gates  of  darkness  and  the  hard  bolts 
of  chaos,  and  thou  hast  turned  me  away  from 
the  region  where  I  had  transgressed,  and  when 
they  had  taken  my  light  away  from  me,  because 
I  had  transgressed  and  had  ceased  to  perform 
my  mystery.  I  have  come  forth  from  the  gates 
of  chaos,  and  when  I  was  constrained,  I  sang  a 
song  to  the  light.  It  hath  preserved  me  from 
all  my  afflictions.  Thou  hast  sent  unto  me  thy 
stream  ;  it  hath  given  me  power,  and  hath  saved 
me  from  all  my  anguish.

"  '  I  will  confess  thee,  0  light,  for  thou  hast 
preserved  me,  and  thy  wonders  have  been  done 
in  the  race  of  men.'
