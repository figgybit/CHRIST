word,  therefore,  thou  hast  spoken  unto  us  afore- 
time, saying,  '  The  foes  of  a  man  are  the  dwellers 
in  his  own  house ' ;  that  is  to  say,  the  dwellers  in 
the  house  of  the  soul  are  the  counterfeit  of  the 
spirit  and  the  destiny,  who  are  ever  the  foes  of  the 
soul,  and  cause  it  to  commit  every  kind  of  sin  and 
iniquity.  This,  0  Master,  is  the  third  intuition. 
"  The  fourth  intuition  is  concerning  the  word 
which  thou  hast  said,  '  When  the  soul  hath  come 
forth  from  the  body  and  goeth  on  its  way  with 
the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit,  if  it  hath  not  found 
the  mystery  of  the  breaking  of  all  the  bonds  and 
the  seals  which  are  bound  to  the  counterfeit  of 
the  spirit,  so  that  it  may  cease  to  haunt  it — 
if,  then,  it  hath  not  found  it,  the  counterfeit  of 
the  spirit  bringeth  the  soul  before  the  virgin  of 
light  who  is  the  judge,  and  the  virgin  of  light 
examineth  the  soul,  (296)  to  see  if  it  hath 
sinned  and  to  find  out  also  if  it  hath  with  it 
the  mysteries  of  light.  [The  virgin  of  light  then] 
handeth  it  over  to  one  of  her  receivers,  and  her 
receiver  leadeth  it  forth  and  casteth  it  into  a 
body,  and  it  is  not  set  free  from  transmigration 
into  bodies  before  it  hath  given  [signs  of  being 
in]  its  last  cycle ' — concerning  this  word,  then, 
O  Master,  thou  hast  said  unto  us  aforetime, 
*  Agree  with  thine  enemy  whilst  thou   ^  saymg

the  judge  deliver  thee  to  the  officer,  and  the 
officer  cast  thee  into  prison;  thou  shalt  not  come 
out  thence  till  thou  hast  paid  the  uttermost 
farthing.'
