"  And  again  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
*  They  have  raised  up  firmly  the  limbs  which 
were  fallen,  so  that  they  might  not  perish '  ;  that 
is,  when  they  had  poured  into  her  her  light- 
powers,  they  confirmed  all  the  powers  which 
[otherwise]  would  have  perished.

"  And  again  as  to  the  saying  of  thy  light- 
power,  *  They  have  had  their  light  renewed,  and 
they  have  become  what  they  were  of  old,' 
and  also  the  word  which  it  spake,  '  They  have 
given  light  to  their  eyes  ' ;  that  is,  they  have 
gained  perception  in  the  light,  and  have  known

the  light-stream,  for  it  was  [previously]  hidden 
in  the  height.

"  And  again  the  word  which  it  spake,  '  And 
all  knew  each  other  in  the  lord '  ;  that  is,  all 
the  powers  of  Pistis  Sophia  knew  one  another 
through  the  light-stream.

"  And  again  the  word  which  it  uttered,  '  They 
have  been  saved  by  the  water  of  life  everlasting  ; 
it  hath  drawn  them  over  the  temple ' ;  that  is, 
when  the  light-stream  had  taken  all  the  light- 
powers  of  Pistis  Sophia,  (135)  and  had  wrested 
them  from  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  it  poured 
them  into  Pistis  Sophia,  and  turned  itself  about, 
and  departed  from  the  chaos ;  it  came  upon

which  thy  light-power  spake  in  the  Ode  of

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the  first 
mystery  had  heard  all  these  words  which  Peter 
had  spoken,  that  he  said  unto  him:  "Well 
said,  0  blessed  Peter ;  this  is  the  interpretation 
of  the  words  which  have  been  spoken."
