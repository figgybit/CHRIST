And  when  Jesus  had  spoken  these  things  to 
his  disciples,  Thomas  came  forward  and  said : 
"  Master,  I  am  sober,  1  am  more  than  sober,  and 
my  mind  is  quick  in  nie,  and  I  rejoice  greatly 
that  thou  hast  revealed  these  things  unto  us. 
Now,  therefore,  I  have  endured  my  brethren 
unto  this  moment,  for  I  have  felt  no  wrath 
against  them,  but  I  have  endured  that  each  of 
them  should  come  to  thee  and  expound  the  in- 
terpretation of  the  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia. 
.  .  .  (80)  Now,  therefore,  my  Master,  concerning 
the  interpretation  of  the  seventh  repentance  of 
Pistis  Sophia,  thy  light-power  hath  prophesied 
through  David,  the  prophet,  in  the  twenty- 
fourth   Psalm,   saying  :

"  '  Unto  thee,  0  lord,  have  I  lifted  up  my 
Thomas  in-  soul.  My  God,  I  have  placed  my 
the^selenth  li^art  in  thee.  0  let  me  not  be  asham- 
fronTp^saim  ^^'  ^^^  ^^^  ^^^  mine  eucmies  mock 
^^'^^  at  me  ;  for  whosoever  hopeth  in  thee

shall  not  be  ashamed.  Let  them  who  do 
iniquity  without  a  cause,  be  ashamed.  Show 
me  thy  path,  0  lord,  and  teach  me  thy  ways. 
Lead  me  in  the  way  of  truth,  and  teach  me,  for 
thou  art  my  God,  and  my  saviour.  I  will  hope 
in  thee  all  the  day  long.  Call  to  remembrance, 
0  lord,  thy  mercies,  and  thy  loving-kindnesses
