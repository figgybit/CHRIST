until  the  day  when  the  great  dragon-faced  ruler 
(386)  who  encircleth  the  darkness,  shall  be

"  This  is  the  punishment  of  the  blasphemer."

Bartholomew  said  :  "  [In  the  case  of]  a  man 
that  lieth  with  a  man,  what  is  his  punishment  ? "

Jesus  said  :   "  [In  the  case  of]  the   Thepunish- 
man   that  lieth   wdth  a  man,  and  the   ™im\hat

"  When  the  time  is  fulfilled  by  the  sphere, 
the  receivers  of  laklabaoth  come  to  find  their

Thomas  said  :  "  We  have  heard  that  there  are 
men  on  the  earth  who  take  the  sperm  of  men  and 
the  flux  of  women,  and  mix  them  with  lentils 
and  eat  them,  saying,  (387)  '  We  believe  in  Esau 
and  Jacob.'      Surely  this  is  an  unseemly  deed  ? "
