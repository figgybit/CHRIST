cause,  therefore,  give  it  unto  none,  and  teach  it 
not  until  ye  have  established  the  faith   in  the 
whole  world,  in  order  that,  when  you  enter  into 
cities  or  countries,  and  they  do  not  receive  you, 
nor  believe  on  you,  nor  give  ear  unto  your  words, 
ye  may  then  raise  the  dead  in  those  regions,  and 
heal  the  lame,  the  blind,  and  all  kinds  of  diseases 
in  those  regions,  and  by  all  such  means,  they 
will  believe  on  you,  that  ye  preach  the  God  of 
the  perfection,  and   will  have   faith  in  all  your 
words.     For  this  cause  have  I   given   unto  you 
this  mystery,  until  ye  shall  have  established  the 
faith  in  the  whole  world."
