as  we  see  from  the  title  of  his  work,  to  be  written  by 
the  hand  of  Valentinus  ;  but  Petermann  is  of  the  opinion 
that  it  is  the  work  of  an  Ophite,  and  promises  to  set  forth 
his  reasons  at  length  in  a  treatise,  which  has  unfortunately 
never  seen  the  light.  Kcistlin  and  Schmidt  also  hold  this 
view,  and  as  far  as  the  Extracts  from  the  Books  of  the 
Saviour  are  concerned,  I  see  no  reason  why  there  should  not 
be  some  truth  in  the  idea.  For  we  may  connect  these 
Books  closely  with  the  Books  of  leou,  and  the  latter  connect 
us  at  once  with  the  Enochian  literature.  The  Ophites 
were  pre-Valentinian  and  mostly  Syrian.  They  were  the 
first  to  take  the  distinct  name  of  Gnostics.  Some  of  their 
books  were  translated  into  Greek.  This  fits  in  with  the 
hypothesis  put  forth  above  that  Valentinus  compiled  the 
Books  of  the  Saviour  from  a  prior  set  of  Gnostic  writings. 
The  Melchisedecian  ideas  would  also  come  through  the 
Syrian  Gnosis,  and  be  cognate  to  the  Enochian  tradition. 
A  review  of  Schwartze's  work  appeared  in  the  Journal  des 
Savants  of  1852  (p.  333).
