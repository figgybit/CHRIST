ing.  foj.  J  question  thee    on  every  matter

with  earnestness  and  confidence,  as  to  the  man- 
ner in  which  we  are  to  preach  to  the  men  of  the 
world."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  John  : 
"  Ask  concerning  every  matter  as  thou  wilt,  and 
I  will  reveal  it  unto  thee,  face  to  face,  with 
freedom,  and  without  parable,  and  with  cer- 
tainty."

(272)  And  John  answered  and  said  :  "  Master, 
when  we  go  forth  to  preach,  and  enter  into  a 
city  or  a  town,  and  the  people  of  that  city  come 
to  meet  us,  and  we  know  not  who  they  are,  if 
they  employ  great  deception  and  hypocrisy,  and 
receive  us,  and  take  us  into  their  houses,  wishing 
to  make  trial  of  the  mysteries  of  light ;  if  they 
are  hypocrites  with  us  in  their  submission,  and 
we  think  that  they  love  God,  and  we  should  give 
them  the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of  light,  and 
afterwards  we  should  discover  that  they  have 
not  acted  in  a  manner  worthy  of  the  mysteries, 
and  we  should  find  out  that  they  have  been 
hypocrites  with  us,  and  have  deceived  us  and 
have  afterwards  made  a  [mere]  mock  of  the 
mysteries  of  the  several  regions,  mimicking  us 
and   [making    forgeries    of]    our  mysteries   also,

kind  ? "
