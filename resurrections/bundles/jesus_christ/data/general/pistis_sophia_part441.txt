when  he  cometh  into  the  eleventh  teon  torments, 
of  the  sphere,  called  the  Waterer,  and  Boubastis 
cometh  into  the  fifth  aeon  of  the  sphere,  called 
the  Lion,  then  the  veils  which  are  between  them 
of  the  left  and  them  of  the  right,  are  drawn 
aside,  that  the  great  lao,  the  good,  he  of  the 
midst,  who  presideth  over  the  region  of  lach- 
thanabas,  may  gaze  forth,  that  his  regions  may 
be  dissolved  and  perish,  and  that  all  the  souls 
which  are  in  his  torments  may  be  brought  forth 
and  again  restored  to  the  sphere,  for  they  are 
perishing  in  his  torments.

"  These  then  are  the  operations  of  the  ways  of 
the  midst  concerning  w^hich  ye  have  questioned 
me."

And  when  the  disciples  had  heard  this,  they 
bowed  down  and  adored  him  saying  :  ^j^g  ^jg_ 
"  Save  us,  0  Master,  have  mercy  upon  seech  Jesus 
us,  that  we  may  be  preserved  from  ^ercy  upon 
these  malignant  torments  which  are  ^^*^^^^^- 
prepared  for  sinners.  (372)  Woe  unto  them  ! 
woe  unto  the  children  of  men  !  for  they  are  like 
the  blind  feeling  in  the  darkness,  and  seeing  not.

374  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

Have  mercy  upon  us,  0  Master,  in  the  great 
blindness  in  which  we  are ;  and  have  mercy 
upon  the  whole  race  of  human  kind,  for  they  lie 
in  wait  for  their  souls,  as  lions  for  their  prey,  to 
tear  them  in  pieces  and  make  food  for  their  tor- 
ments, because  of  the  forgetfulness  and  ignorance 
in  which  they  are.  Have  mercy,  therefore,  upon 
us,  0  Master,  our  saviour,  have  mercy  upon  us, 
preserve  us  from  this  great  stupor."

Jesus  said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  Have  courage, 
Jesus  en-  ^^''^^'  ^^^^^  ^^^'  7^  ^^'^  blcssed  ;  nay,  I
