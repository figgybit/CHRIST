" '  But  thou,  lord,  thou  art  the  light  eternal, 
and  thou  dost  visit  them  whom  they  constrain, 
at  all  times.  Now,  therefore,  0  light,  arise,  seek 
my  power  and  the  soul  which  is  in  me.  Thy 
commandment  is  accomplished,  which  thou 
didst  decree  for  me  in  my  afflictions.  My  time 
is  come  for  thee  to  visit  my  power  and  my  soul. 
This  is  the  time  which  thou  didst  decree  that 
thou  wouldst  visit  me,  so  that  the  saviours 
should  seek  for  the  power  which  is  in  my  soul 
(for  its  number  is  accomplished),  and  that  they 
should  also  save  the  matter  thereof.  At  that  time, 
then,  all  the  rulers  of  the  material  aeons  shall  fear 
thy  light,  and  all   the   emanations  of  the  thir-

teenth  material  aeon  shall  fear  the  mystery  of  thy 
light,  and  thus  cause  the  others  to  put  on  the 
glory  of  their  light,  for  the  sa^dour  shall  visit 
the  power  of  their  soul.  He  hath  revealed  his 
mystery,  for  he  will  regard  the  repentance  of 
them  who  inhabit  the  lower  regions,  nor  will  he 
disregard  their  repentance.  This,  then,  is  that 
mystery  which  hath  become  the  type  for  the 
race  which  shall  be  engendered  ;  and  the  race 
which  shall  be  engendered  will  sing  a  song 
to  the  height,  for  the  light  hath  regarded  from 
the  height  of  its  light.  (65)  It  will  regard 
every  matter,  to  hear  the  sighs  of  them  that 
are  bound,  to  unloose  the  power  of  the  souls 
whose  power  is  bound,  and  to  place  his  name  in 
the  soul,  and  his  mystery  in  the  power.' "

It  came  to  pass  that  when  Jesus  had  spoken 
these  words  unto  his  disciples,  saying
