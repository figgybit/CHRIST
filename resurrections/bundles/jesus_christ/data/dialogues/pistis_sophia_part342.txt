him  many  times  seven  times,  and  each  of  the  in- 
time  give  ye  him  the  mysteries  from  g^nnShlnd 
the  beginning,  [the  mysteries]  which  u^^tll^^s^e^en 
are  in  the  first  space  from  the  ex-  *i°^^s- 
terior ;  perchance  ye  will  win  the  soul  of  that 
brother,  so  that  he  may  inherit  the  kingdom  of 
light.

"  For  this  cause,  when  ye  questioned  me  afore- 
time, saying,  (265)  'If  our  brother  sin    a  former

against  us,  wilt  thou  that  we  forgive   explained. 
him  unto  seven  times  ? '     I  answered  and  said 
unto  you,  '  Not  only  unto  seven  times,  but  unto 
seventy  times  seven.'

"  Now,  therefore,  remit  ye  his  sin  many  times, 
and  every  time  give  unto  him  the  external 
mysteries,  those  which  are  in  the  first  space ; 
perchance  ye  shall  win  the  soul  of  that  brother, 
so  that  he  may  inherit  the  kingdom  of  light.

"  Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  he  who  shall  give 
life  unto  a  single  soul,  and  shall  save  of  the  re- 
it,  in  addition  to  his  own  proper  light  Tavelt*^^ 
in  the  kingdom  of  light,  he  shall  further  ^°^^^' 
receive  an  additional  glory  for  the  soul  which  he 
shall  have  saved,  so  that  he  who  shall  save  a 
host  of  souls,  in  addition  to  his  own  proper 
glory  in  the  glory,  he  shall  receive  a  host  of  ad- 
ditional glories  for  the  souls  which  he  shall  have 
saved."
