u.  1895.  Amelineau.  Pistis  Sophia,  Ouvrage  gnostique  de 
Valentin,  traduit  du  copte  en  fran^ais,  avec  une 
Introduction  (Paris),  pp.  xxxii.  and  204,  8vo.

Amelineau  goes  thoroughly  into  the  Valentinian  origin 
of  the  treatise,  but  leans  almost  exclusively  to  an  Egyptian 
origin  of  the  ideas.  The  MS.  itself,  however,  he  places  very 
late,  writing  on  page  xi.  of  his  Introduction  as  follows : 
"  After  an  examination  of  the  enormous  faults  which  the 
scribe  has  committed,  I  cannot  attribute  to  the  MS.  which 
has  preserved  the  Pistis  Sophia  to  us,  a  date  later  than  the 
ninth  or  tenth  century,  and  that  too  the  minimum.  For 
this  I  have  several  reasons.  Firstly,  the  MS.  is  written  on 
parchment,  and  parchment  was  hardly  ever  commonly  used 
in  Egypt  before  the  sixth  or  seventh  century.  Secondly, 
the  writing,  which  is  uncial,  though  passable  in  the  first 
pages  of  the  MS.,  becomes  bastard  in  a  large  number  of 
leaves,  when  the  scribe's  hand  is  fatigued  ;  no  longer  is  it 
the  beautiful  writing  of  the  Egyptian  scribes  of  the  great 
periods,  but  slack,  inconsistent,  almost  round  and  hurried. 
Thirdly,  the  faults  of  orthography  in  the  use  of  Greek  words

evidently  show  that  the  scribe  belonged  to  a"  period  when 
Greek  was  almost  no  longer  known."
