fore, give  ear,  0  Mary.  Concerning  the  word 
on  which  thou  hast  questioned  me,  to  wit,  '  Who 
constraineth  a  man  to  sin  ? ' â€” now,  therefore, 
[will  I  tell  it  thee].  When  the  babe  cometh  into 
the  world,  the  power  is  feeble  in  it,  the  soul  also 
is  feeble  in  it,  and  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  is 
also  feeble  in  it ;  in  a  word,  the  three  are  all  of 
them  feeble.  None  of  them  hath  sense  enough 
for  any  work,  whether  good  or  evil,  because  of 
the  exceeding  great  weight  of  oblivion  ;  and  the 
body  too  is  feeble.  And  the  babe  eateth  of  the 
delights  of  the  world  of  the  rulers,  (282)  and  the 
power  absorbeth  from  the  portion  of  the  power 
which  is  in  the  delights,  and  the  soul  absorb- 
eth from  the  portion  of  the  soul  which  is  in 
the  delights,  and  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit 
absorbeth  from  the  portion  of  the  evil  which  is 
in  the  delights  and  their  desires,  and  the  body 
also  absorbeth  the  unperceptive  matter  which 
is  in  the  delights.  As  to  the  destiny,  it  taketh 
nothing  from  the  delights,  for  it  is  not  mingled 
with  them,  but  it  continueth  of  the  same  quality 
with  which  it  came  into  the  world.

"  And  little  by  little  the  power,  the  soul  and 
the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  develop,  and  each 
of  them  senseth  according  to  its  nature.     The

power  senseth  after  the  light  of  the  height ;  the 
soul  also  senseth  after  the  region  of  mixed 
righteousness,  which  is  the  region  of  the  mixture  ; 
the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  seeketh  after  all 
vices,  and  desires,  and  sins ;  but  the  body  hath 
no  power  of  sensing  unless  it  be  an  impulse  to 
gain  strength  from  matter.
