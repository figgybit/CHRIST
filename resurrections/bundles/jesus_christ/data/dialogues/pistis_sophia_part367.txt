sealeth  it  with  his  seals,  and  the  soul  presenteth 
its  gnosis  and  the  glory  of  its  songs  and  the 
seals  to  every  region  of  them  that  are  on  the 
right.  And  all  seal  it  with  their  seals  ;  and 
then  Melchisedec,  the  great  receiver  of  light, 
who  inhabiteth  the  region  of  thena  of  the  right, 
sealeth  that  soul,  and  all  the  receivers  of  Mel- 
chisedec seal  that  soul,  and  [Melchisedec] 
bringeth  it  into  the  treasure  of  light.

"  And  it  presenteth  the  glory  and  worship  and 
honour  of  its  songs,  with  all  the  seals  of  all  the 
region  of  the  light ;  and  all  they  of  the  region 
of  the  treasure  of  light  seal  it  with  their  seals, 
and  it  cometh  unto  the  region  of  the  inherit- 
ance."

When,  then,  the  saviour  had  spoken  these 
things  unto  his  disciples,  he  said  unto  them  : 
(293)  "  Understand  ye  how  I  speak  unto  you  ?  "

And  Mary  came  forward  again  and  said  : 
Mary  inter-  "Yea,  Mastcr,  I  Understand  how  thou 
teaching^^  spcakcst  uuto  mc,  and  I  comprehend 
from  for-       ^jj  thcsc  things.     Now,  therefore,  con-

ings.  cerning  the  words  which  thou  hast  said

unto  us,  my  mind  hath  had  four  intuitions  ;  my 
indweller  of  light  impelleth  me,  and  blissfully 
seetheth  within  me,  longing  to  come  forth  from 
me  and  enter  into  thee.  Now,  therefore,  0 
Master,  hearken  while  I  tell  thee  the  four  intui- 
tions which  have  come  unto  me.
