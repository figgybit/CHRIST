which  have  been  ever  of  old.  0  remember  not 
the  sins  of  my  childhood  and  my  ignorance. 
But  think  upon  me  according  to  the  abundance 
of  thy  mercy,  because  of  thy  goodness,  0  lord. 
The  lord  is  gracious  and  righteous ;  therefore 
shall  he  teach  sinners  in  the  way.  (81)  He  will 
guide  the  gentle  with  judgment,  he  will  teach 
the  gentle  his  ways.  All  the  ways  of  the  lord 
are  good,  in  sooth,  for  them  that  seek  his 
righteousness  and  his  testimonies.  For  thy 
name's  sake,  0  lord,  pardon  my  sin,  for  it  is 
very  great.  What  man  is  he  who  feareth  the 
lord,  with  him  shall  he  establish  a  law  in  the 
way  he  shall  choose.  His  soul  shall  dwell  at 
ease,  and  his  seed  shall  inherit  the  land.  The 
lord  is  the  support  of  them  that  fear  him  ;  and 
the  name  of  the  lord  is  with  them  that  fear 
him,  to  teach  them  his  covenant.  Mine  eyes 
gaze  upon  the  lord  for  ever,  for  it  is  he  who 
shall  pluck  my  feet  out  of  the  snare.  Look 
upon  me,  have  mercy  upon  me,  for  I  am  an  only 
son,  I  am  a  beggar,  I.  The  sorrows  of  my  heart 
are  enlarged  ;  0  bring  me  out  of  my  constraints. 
Look  upon  my  abasement,  my  misery,  and  for- 
give me  all  my  sin.  Consider  mine  enemies, 
how  many  they  are,  and  they  hate  me  with 
cruel  hatred.  0  guard  my  soul,  and  save  me  ; 
let  me  not  be  ashamed,  for  I  have  hoped  in  thee. 
(82)  The  simple  and  the  righteous  clung  to  me,

for  I  hoped  in  thee.  0  lord  God,  preserve 
Israel  from  all  her  troubles.'  "
