    "body": "Dear Professor,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I'm working on an ambitious project called C.H.R.I.S.T. - a system for consciousness capture and preservation.\n\nThe core idea is to create an ethical, privacy-preserving platform that can:\n- Ingest personal data from various sources\n- Build a knowledge graph of memories and experiences\n- Enable AI-powered retrieval and reflection\n- Maintain complete user sovereignty over data\n\nI'm particularly struggling with the philosophical implications. How do we define consciousness in a digital context? What aspects of human experience can truly be captured?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts when you have time.\n\nBest wishes,\nYour Former Student"

There are some real treasures here - including that photo of great-grandpa with his first computer in 1982!\n\nI've organized them by decade:\n- 1950s: Grandparents' wedding, early childhood\n- 1960s: Family vacations, school events\n- 1970s: Your parents' graduation, our first house\n- 1980s: Holiday gatherings, birthday parties\n- 1990s: Your childhood, family milestones\n\nThese memories are priceless. So glad we're preserving them digitally now.\n\nLove,\nMom\n\nP.S. - Your dad found his old journal from college. Should I scan that too?"
