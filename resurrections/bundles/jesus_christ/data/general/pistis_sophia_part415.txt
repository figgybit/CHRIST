iniquity.  But  they  have  given  com-  *  ^  ^^^"*' 
mandment  unto  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit, 
saying,  '  If  the  soul  passeth  out  of  the  body,  do 
not  agitate  it,  dogging  it,  reproaching  it  in  all 
the  regions  of  the  judgments,  region  by  region, 
because  of  all  the  sins  which  thou  hast  caused  it 
to  commit,  that  it  may  be  chastised  in  all  the 
regions  of  the  judgments,  and  not  be  able  to  go 
on  high  towards  the  light,  (344)  and  be  made 
to  come  back  into  transmigrations  into  bodies.'

"  In  a  word,  they  give  commandment  to  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit,  saying,  '  Do  not  agitate 
it  at  all  at  any  time,  unless  it  hath  not  received 
the  breaking  of  all  the  seals  and  of  all  the  bonds 
with  which   we    have    bound   thee    to  it.     But

if  it  receiveth  the  mysteries,  if  it  breaketh  all 
the  seals,  all  the  bonds,  with  the  apology  of  the 
region,  and  if  it  pass  out,  let  it  go,  for  it  per- 
tain eth  to  those  of  the  light  of  the  height,  it 
hath  become  a  stranger  unto  us  and  thee,  thou 
canst  not  seize  hold  of  it  from  that  hour.  But 
if  it  hath  not  received  the  mysteries  of  the 
breaking  of  thy  bonds  and  of  thy  seals  with  the 
apologies  of  the  region,  seize  hold  upon  it,  and 
let  it  not  go,  rebuke  it  in  the  torments  and  all 
the  regions  of  the  judgments,  because  of  all  the 
sins  which  thou  hast  caused  it  to  commit.  After 
this,  then,  bring  such  souls  unto  the  virgin  of 
light,  and  she  will  send  them  round  the  cycle 
another  time.'  These  are  [the  orders]  which  the 
rulers  of  the  great  fate  have  given  unto  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit.
