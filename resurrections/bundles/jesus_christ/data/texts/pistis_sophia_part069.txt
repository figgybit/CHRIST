We  may  also  mention  the  Codex  Nazareeus,  although  it 
is  said  at  earliest  to  be  post-Mohammedan,  of  which  there 
are  no  less  than  four  MS.  copies,  dated  respectively  1560, 
1632,  1688  and  1730,  in  the  Bibliotheque  Nationale  alone. 
This  Codex  is  the  scripture  of  the  so-called  Sabeeans,  or 
Christians  of   St.  John,    or  Mandaites,    and  is   known   as

INTRODUCTION.  XXI

Sidra  Adma  or  The  Book  of  Adam.  The  text,  in  a  strange 
Chaldteo-Syriac  idiom,  was  first  published  at  Lund  (1815, 
1816),  by  Matth.  Norberg,  the  learned  Swede,  together 
with  a  vocabulary  and  a  Latin  translation,  in  four  quarto 
volumes.  There  is  also  a  French  translation  by  F.  Tempes- 
tini  in  Migne's  Dictionuaire  des  Apocryphes  (1856).  Compare 
also  the  thesis,  Stellse  Nasarteorum  Ji^ones  ex  Sacro  Gentis 
Codice,  by  Olof  Svanander,  presumably  a  pupil  of  Norberg 
(Lund,  1811).
