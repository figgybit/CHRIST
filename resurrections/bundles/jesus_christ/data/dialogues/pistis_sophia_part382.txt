"  Concerning  this  word  thou  hast  spoken  unto 
us  aforetime,  saying,  '  Salt  is  good ;  but  if  the 
salt  have  lost  its  savour,  wherewith  shall  it  be 
salted  ?  It  is  fit  neither  for  the  dunghill  nor  for 
the  earth ;  they  cast  it  away ' ;  that  is  to  say, 
the  soul  that  shall  receive  the  mysteries  of  that 
ineffable,  is  [indeed]  blessed,  but  should  it  once 
transgress  [without  repentance],  it  is  no  longer 
fit  to  come  back  into  the  body  henceforth  from 
that  hour,  nor  [is  it  fit]  for  anything  else,  but  it 
is  cast  out  into  the  outer  darkness,  that  it  may 
perish  there."

And  when  she  had  spoken  these  words,  the 
saviour  said :  "  Well  said,  Mary,  thou  spiritual 
one  of  pure  light  ;  that  is  the  interpretation  of 
the  saying."

(309)  And  Mary  continued  and  said  :  "  Again, 
0  Master,  as  to  them  that  shall  have  received 
the  mysteries  of  the  first  mystery  and  the 
mystery  of  that  ineffable,  and  who  have  not 
yet  transgressed,  whose  faith  in  the  mysteries 
is  true  without  hypocrisy,  but  who  by  the 
necessity  of  fate  shall  come  to  sin  again,  and 
shall  again  turn  and  make  repentance,  and  offer 
prayer  anew  in  all  the  mysteries  [they  have 
received],  how  often  shall  it  be  remitted  unto 
them  ? "
