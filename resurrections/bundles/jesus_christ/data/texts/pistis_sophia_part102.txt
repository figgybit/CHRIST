Schmidt  agrees  with  Harnack  as  to  date,  and  thinks  that 
tlie  Pistis  Sophia  niay  be  attributed  to  an  Ophite  school. 
In  the  works  of  the  three  writers  referred  to  above  there  is  a 
mass  of  infonnation  with  regard  to  the  Pistis  Sophia,  but  as 
only  the  date  and  to  some  extent  the  authorship  are  being 
dealt  with  in  this  Introduction,  the  further  consideration  of 
their  views  must  be  postponed  until  a  Commentary  to  form 
a  complement  to  the  present  translation  is  attempted.
