In  a  footnote  Am^lineau  says  that  he  is  perfectly  aware 
that  this  opinion  of  his  will  "raise  a  tempest,"  and  begs 
for  a  suspension  of  judgment  till  he  has  published  his 
reasons  as  to  the  late  use  of  parchment,  at  greater  length. 
Now  it  was  Ptolemy  II.  (Philadelphus),  King  of  Egypt 
from  283-247  b.c,  who  fox'bade  the  exportation  of  papy- 
rus from  Egypt,  and  forced  the  rival  bibliophiles  at 
Pergamus  to  copy  their  books  on  parchment.  The  library 
of  Pergamus  was  bequeathed  to  the  Senate  of  Rome,  and 
Antony  handed  it  over  to  Cleopatra  somewhere  about  35 
B.C.  ;  this  library,  consisting  for  the  most  part  of  parchment 
rolls  and  books,  was  placed  in  the  new  Brucheion  at 
Alexandria,  to  replace  the  old  Library  which  was  totally 
destroyed  by  the  fire  of  Caesar's  fleet  in  47.  Parchment, 
then,  was  common  enough  as  a  book-fabric  in  Alexandria, 
at  least  600  years  before  Am^lineau's  limit.

An  examination  of  the  MS.  does  not  entirely  substantiate 
the  strictures  of  Amelineau  on  the  careless  writing  of  the 
scribe ;  the  writing  though  hurried  is  fairly  consistent, 
while  the  first  dozen  pages  are  most  admirably  written. 
The  faults  of  spelling  only  prove  that  this  particular  scribe 
did  not  know  Geeek,  a  likely  enough  thing  if  the  copy  was 
made  in  Upper  Egypt  and  not  at  Alexandria.  I  am,  there- 
fore, far  from  convinced  by  any  one  of  the  reasons  Ame- 
lineau brings  forward.

Sophia  (Leipzig).

I  have  already  given  Harnack's  views  on  the  date  ;  he 
attributes  the  authorship  to  a  modified  Ophite  origin.  He 
suggests  that  Book  I.  only  is  properly  Pistis  Sophia  ;  Book 
II.  should  be  called  the  Questions  of  Mary  (p.  94).
