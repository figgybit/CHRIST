plained,  parable,  saying  unto  you,  '  If  thy 
brother  sin  against  thee,  reprove  him  alone  ;  if 
he  hearken  unto  thee,  thou  shall  have  won  thy 
brother  ;  if  he  hearken  not  unto  thee,  take  with 
thee  another  [brother]  ;  if  he  still  will  not  hear 
thee  or  that  other  [brother],  bring  him  before 
the  assembly  ;  if  he  hearken  not  unto  the  rest 
[of  the  brethren],  let  him  be  for  you  as  a  trans- 
gressor and  a  stumbling-block.'

"  If  he  prove  not  worthy  in  the  first  mystery, 
give  him  the  second  ;  and  if  he  prove  unworthy 
in  the  second,  give  him  the  three,  one  after 
the  other — that  is  to  say,  the  '  assembly  ' — and

lished,'  signifieth  that  these  three  of  sin. 
mysteries  shall  witness  against  his  last  repent- 
ance. (269)  Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  [even] 
should  that  man  repent,  there  is  no  mystery 
which  can  remit  his  sins  and  accept  his  repent- 
ance, there  is  not  the  least  possibility  of  any 
mystery  at  all  listening  unto  him,  save  only  the 
first  mystery  of  the  first  mystery  and  the  mys- 
teries of  that  inefiable.  They  alone  will  accept 
the  repentance  of  that  man  and  will  remit  his 
sins,  for  those  mysteries  are  compassionate  and 
merciful-minded,  and  grant  remission  at  any 
time."
