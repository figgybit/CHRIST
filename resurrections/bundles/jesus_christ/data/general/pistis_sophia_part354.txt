of  that  inefiable  ;  [only]  while  a  man  is  [still] 
engaged  in  completing  that  mystery  in  all  its 
configurations  and  all  its  types  and  all  its  states, 
he  shall  not  depart  from  the  body  [under  such 
circumstances]  ;  but  after  the  perfect  accom- 
plishment of  that  mystery  in  all  its  configura- 
tions and  all  its  types,  (278)  [then]  after  this  at

In  that  moment  he  shall  depart  from  the  body 
of  the  matter  of  the  rulers,  and  his  soul  shall  be-

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  :  "  Ask

Master,  hast  thou  not  [also]  brought  the  mysteries
