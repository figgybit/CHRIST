in  every  region,  because  of  your  repourings 
into  different  bodies,  and  because  of  all  your 
tribulations,  ye  have,  after  all,  received  the 
purifying  mysteries,  and  are  become  pure  light 
exceedingly  refined.  For  this  cause,  therefore, 
ye  shall  enter  into  the  height,  ye  shall  come  to 
the  interior  of  all  the  regions  of  all  these  great 
emanations  of  the  light,  ye  shall  be  kings  in 
the  kingdom  of  light  for  ever.  This  is  the 
explanation  of  the  words  on  which  ye  question

right,  and  into  the  regions  of  all  those  great 
emanations  of  the  light,  ye  shall  receive  glory
