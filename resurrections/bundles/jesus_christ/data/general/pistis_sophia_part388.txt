ear  unto  him  and  grant  the  remission  of  his  sins. 
Now,  therefore,  0  Mary,  let  thy  brethren  give 
him  a  higher  mysterv  than  that  which  he  hath 
received,  and  his  repentance  shall  be  heard  and 
his  sins  be  forgiven  him.  The  mystery  which 
he  may  receive  a  second  time  or  any  number  of 
times,  will  not  grant  him  the  remission  of  his 
sin,  but  only  a  higher  mystery  to  the  one  he 
hath  [previously]  received  will  grant  him  re- 
mission. But  if  he  have  [already]  received  the 
three  mysteries  in  the  two  spaces  or  in  the  third, 
and  [then]  turneth  back  and  transgresseth, 
no  mystery  can  give  ear  unto  him  to  help  him 
in  his  repentance,  neither  mysteries  higher 
nor  lower  than  the  one  he  hath  received,  save 
only  the  mystery  of  the  first  mystery  and  the 
mystery  of  that  ineffable.  It  is  these  that 
shall  give  ear  unto  him  and  receive  his  repent- 
ance".

And   Mary  answered  and   said :    "  Again,   0

SECOND   BOOK.  315

Master,  as  to  the  man  who  hath  received  the 
mysteries  twice  or  thrice  (315)  in  the  two  spaces 
and  in  the  third,  and  hath  not  transgressed,  but 
continueth  in  his  faith  truly  and  without 
hypocrisy,  [what  of  him]  ?  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  :
