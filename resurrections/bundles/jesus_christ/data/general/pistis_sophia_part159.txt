" '  In  thee,  0  God,  my  God,  I  have  put  my 
trust,  let  me  not  be  put  to  confusion  for  ever. 
Preserve  me  in  thy  righteousness,  and  save  me. 
Incline  thine  ear  unto  me  to  preserve  me.  Be 
thou  unto  me  a  strong  God,  and  a  stronghold 
to  preserve  me.  For  thou  art  my  foundation 
and  my  refuge.  0  my  God,  save  me  from  the 
hand  of  the  sinner,  from  the  hand  of  the  trans- 
gressor of  the  law,  and  from  the  impious,  for 
thou  art  my  support,  0  lord,  thou  art  my  hope 
from  my  childhood  ;  by  thee  have  I  been  holden 
up  from  the  beginning,  when  thou  causedst  me 
to  come  forth  from  my  mother's  womb.  I  will 
call  thee  to  mind  for  ever.  (59)  I  was  as  one 
of  the  foolish  for  the  crowd.  Thou  art  my  help

bless  the  glory  of  thy  greatness  all  the  day  long. 
Cast  me  not  aw^ay  in  the  time  of  age,  and  cause 
not  my  soul  to  be  without  strength.  Cast  me 
not  behind  thee,  for  mine  enemies  speak  evil 
against  me  ;  and  they  who  keep  watch  on  my 
soul  have  taken  counsel  together,  saying,  "  God

hath  forsaken  him.  Run  and  take  him,  for 
there  is  no  one  to  help  him."  0  God,  haste 
thee  to  my  help.  Let  them  be  ashamed,  let 
them  cease  to  accuse  my  soul,  let  them  be 
covered  with  shame  and  affliction  who  seek  to 
do  me  evil.'

"This,  then,  is  the  interpretation  of  the  second 
repentance  which  Pistis  Sophia  made."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Peter : 
"  It  is  well,   Peter ;  that  is   the  inter-
