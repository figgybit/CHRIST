"  Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  she  will  not  suffer 
that  soul  to  escape  from  transmigrations  into 
bodies  until  it  hath  given  signs  of  [being  in]  its 
last  cycle  according  to  its  record  of  demerit. 
And  concerning  all  this  I  will  tell  you  the  types 
and  also  the  types  of  bodies  into  which  souls 
shall  be  cast  according  to  their  sins  ;  all  this  will 
I  tell  you  when  I  come  to  explain  to  you  the 
emanation  of  the  pleroma."

And  Jesus  continued  further  in  his  conversa- 
Of  the  tion  and  said  :  "  But  [in  the  case  of]  a

of  theright-  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  in  all  its  works, 
that  hath  ^^^  ^^^^  becomc  Hghteous,  and  hath

those  which  are  in  the  third  space  towards  the 
interior  ;  when  the  time  of  that  soul  is  come  for 
its  passing  from  the  body,  then  the  spiritual 
counterfeit  followeth  after  that  soul,  and  also  the 
destiny.  They  follow  after  it  in  the  way  whereby 
it  shall  pass  into  the  height.

"  And  before  it  getteth  far  into  the  height,  it 
uttereth  the  mystery  of  the  breaking  of  the  seals 
and  all  the  bonds  of  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit 
whereby  the  rulers  bind  it  to  the  soul ;  and  when 
[the  mystery]  is  uttered,  the  bonds  of  the  coun- 
terfeit of  the  spirit  are  broken,  so  that  it  ceaseth 
to  shackle  that  soul,  and  letteth  the  soul  go, 
according  to  the  injunctions  which  the  rulers  of 
the  great  fate  have  given  unto  it,  saying,  (287) 
'  Let  not  that  soul  go  until  it  hath  told  thee  the 
mystery  of  the  breaking  of  all  the  seals  where- 
with thou  hast  been  bound  to  it.'
