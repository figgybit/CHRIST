Psalm xc.  say  uuto  the  lord,  "Thou  hast  re- 
ceived me  unto  thyself;  [thou  art]  my  place 
of  refuge."  He  is  my  God  in  whom  I  have 
trusted ;  for  he  shall  save  me  from  the  snares  of 
the  hunters  and  from  them  that  utter  violent 
words.  He  shall  shelter  thee  beneath  his 
breast,  and  thou  shalt  take  courage  beneath  his 
wings.  His  truth  shall  surround  thee  like  a 
breast-plate ;  thou  shalt  not  be  afraid  for  the 
terror  of  the  night  nor  for  the  arrow  which  flieth 
by  day,  for  the  thing  that  strideth  in  darkness, 
that  proceedeth  from  the  destruction  of  the 
dsemonial  one  at  mid-day.  (142)  A  thousand 
shall  fall  on  thy  left,  and  ten  thousand  at  thy 
right  hand ;  but  they  shall  not  come  nigh  thee. 
Thou  shalt  gaze  upon  them,  thou  shalt  see  them

SECOND   BOOK.  141

receive  the  payment  of  sinners ;  for  thou,  O 
lord,  art  my  hope.  Thou  hast  established  for 
thyself  places  of  refuge  in  the  height ;  no  one 
shall  come  nigh  thee,  no  plague  come  nigh  thy 
dwelling ;  for  he  hath  given  commandment  to 
his  messengers  concerning  thee  to  keep  thee  in 
all  thy  ways,  to  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  lest 
thou  dash  thy  foot  against  a  stone.  Thou  shalt 
mount  on  the  serpent  and  basilisk ;  thou  shalt 
trample  under  foot  the  lion  and  the  dragon. 
Because  he  hath  trusted  in  me,  I  will  save  him  ; 
I  will  shelter  him,  because  he  hath  known  my 
name.  He  will  cry  unto  me,  and  I  shall  hear 
him  ;  I  am  with  him  in  his  afflictions,  and  I  will 
save  him  to  glorify  him,  and  increase  him  with 
wealth  of  days,  and  teach  him  my  salvation.'

"  This,  my  Master,  is  the  interpretation  of  the 
words  which  thou  hast  said.  Hearken,  there- 
fore, that  I  may  expound  it  unto  thee  in  free- 
dom.
