"  *  Let  them  confess  the  lord  in  his  mercies, 
and  his  wonders  among  the  children  of  men  ;  for 
he  satisfieth  the  hungry  soul ;  he  hath  filled 
the  hungry  soul  with  good  things.  They  who 
sat  in  darkness  and  the  shadow  of  death,  they 
who  were  bound  in  misery  and  chains,  (180)

lord,  and  had  made  wroth  the  counsel  of  the 
highest — their  heart  is  humbled  in  their  suffer- 
ing, they  have  become  powerless,  and  there  was 
no  one  to  help  them.  They  cried  unto  the 
lord  when  they  were  in  peril,  and  he  hath 
saved  them  out  of  their  constraints ;  he  hath 
brought  them  forth  from  darkness  and  the 
shadow  of  death,  and  hath  broken  their  chains.

"  '  Let  them  confess  the  lord  in  his  mercies 
and  his  wonders  among  the  children  of  men  ; 
for  he  hath  broken  the  gates  of  brass,  he  hath 
smitten  the  bolts  of  iron  asunder.  He  hath 
received  them  unto  himself  in  the  way  of  their 
iniquity.  For  when  they  had  been  brought  low 
because  of  their  iniquities,  their  heart  abhorred 
all  nourishment,  they  were  near  to  the  gates  of 
death.  They  cried  unto  the  lord  in  their  peril, 
— he  preserved  them  from  their  afflictions.

"  '  Let  them  confess  the  lord  in  his  mercies, 
and  his  wonders  among  the  children  of  men.'

"This,  then,  my  Master,  is  the  interpreta- 
tion of  the  song,  which  Pistis  Sophia  uttered. 
Hearken,  therefore.  Master,  that  I  may  expound 
it  clearly.  The  word,  verily,  which  David 
spake,  '  Confess  ye  the  lord,  for  he  is  gracious, 
for  his  mercy  endureth  for  ever ' ;  this  is  the 
word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  1  will  confess 
thee,  0  light,  for  thou  art  a  saviour  and  a 
deliverer  for  all  time.'
