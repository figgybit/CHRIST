(150)  "  '  I  have  been  loosed  from  my  bonds  ;  I 
have  run  unto  thee,  0  lord,  for  thou   Thomas 
wert  at  my  right  hand  preserving  me,    eth^^e^'" 
preserving  and  helping  me.     Thou  hast    ^^A^l 
prevented    them   that   fought   against   Q^^*fÂ® 
me,  and  they  did  not  show  themselves   Solomon. 
because  thy  countenance  was  with  me,  preserv- 
ing me  by  its  beauty.     I    was  despised  before 
the  crowd,  and  have  been   cast  out ;  I  was  as 
lead  in  their  presence.     But  a  power  came  forth 
unto  me  from  thee,  helping  me ;  for  thou  hast 
set  lamps  on  my  right   hand    and    on  my  left, 
so  that  no  part  of  my  being  should  be  without 
light.     Thou  didst  shelter  me  under  the  shadow 
of  thy  mercy,  and  I  was  placed  above  the  coats 
of  skin.     Thy  right  hand   hath  raised   me  up, 
and  hath  taken  my  sickness  from  me.     I  have 
become     strong    in    thy    truth,    pure    in    thy 
righteousness.      They    that   fought   against   me 
have    withdrawn    themselves   from    me,    and    I 
have  been  justified    by  thy  goodness,   for   thy 
rest  is  from  eternity  to  eternity.'

"This,  0  Master,  is  the  interpretation  of  the 
repentance  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  when  she 
was  preserved  from  chaos.  Hearken,  therefore, 
while  I  expound  it  in  freedom.

"The  word,  then,  which  thy  power  spake 
through  Solomon,  '  I  have  been  loosed  from 
bonds,   I  have  run  unto  thee,  0  lord ' ;    this  is

the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  I  have 
been  loosed  from  the  bonds  of  darkness  ;  I  have 
come  unto  thee,  0  light.'
