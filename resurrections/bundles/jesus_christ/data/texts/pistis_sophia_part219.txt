which  went  forth  from  my  mouth,  that  is  to 
say,  thyself.  Thou  hast  had  mercy  on  the 
whole  human  race.  Truth,  also,  is  the  power 
which  was  in  Elizabeth,  that  is  to  say,  John, 
who  came,  and  was  the  herald  before  the  truth, 
that  is  to  say,  who  was  the  herald  before  thee. 
And  again,  *  Mercy  and  truth  are  met  together,' 
'tis  thou,  my  saviour,  when  thou  didst  meet 
John,  on  the  day  when  thou  wast  to  receive  the 
baptism.  Again  'tis  thou  and  John  who  are

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had 
heard  these  words  which  Mary,  his  mother, 
spake,  that  he  said  :  "  Well  said ;  it  is  well. 
This  is  the  interpretation  of  all  the  words  con- 
cerning which  my  light-power  prophesied  of
