"  Manifestly  is  thy  word  concerning  this. 
Every  soul  which  shall  come  forth  from  the 
body,  and  shall  go  on  its  way  with  the  counter- 
feit of  the  spirit,  and  which  hath  not  found  the 
mystery  of  breaking  all  the  seals  and  all  the 
bonds,  that  it  may  be  set  free  from  the  counter- 
feit of  the  spirit  which  is  bound  unto  it ;  well, 
then,  that  soul  which  hath  not  received  the 
mystery  of  light,  and  hath  not  found  the 
mystery  of  detaching  the  counterfeit  of  the 
spirit  which  is  bound  to  it  within â€” if,  then, 
that  soul  hath  not  found  it,  the  counterfeit  of 
the  spirit  bringeth  that  soul  unto  the  virgin  of 
light,  and  the  virgin  of  light,  the  judge,  handetb 
over  that  soul  to  one  of  her  receivers,  (297)  and 
her  receiver  casteth  it  into  the  spheres  of  the 
aeons,  and  it  is  not  set  free  from  transmigrations 
into  bodies,  until  it  giveth  signs  of  being  in  its 
last  cycle.  This,  then,  0  Master,  is  the  fourth 
intuition."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard  the 
words  which  Mary  had  spoken,  that  he  said  : 
"Well  said,  Mary,  most  blessed  and  spiritual. 
These  are  the  interpretations  of  the  words  which 
I  have  spoken."

SECOND    BOOK.  297

And  Mary  answered  and  said  :  "  Yet  again,  0 
Master,  do  I  question  thee,  for  hence-  Mary  con- 
forth  from  this  hour  I  will  begin  to  to  question 
question  thee  on  every  matter  with 
precision.  Wherefore,  then,  0  Master,  be  patient 
with  us,  reveal  every  matter  on  which  we  ques- 
tion thee  as  concerning  the  manner  in  which  my 
brethren  shall  preach  to  the  w^hole  race  of  human 
kind."     This  she  said  to  the  saviour.
