her  mystery,  for  formerly  she  had  been  in  the 
region  of  the  height,  in  the  thirteenth  seon  ;  so 
she  began  to  sing  a  song  to  the  light  which  is 
in  the  height,  which  she  had  seen  in  the  veil  of 
the  treasure  of  light.  It  came  to  pass,  therefore, 
when  she  had  finished  singing  her  song  to  the 
light  which  is  in  the  height,  that  all  the  rulers, 
who  were  near  the  two  great  triple  powers,  and 
her  invisible  paired  with  her,  gazed  [upon  my 
vesture],  as  well  as  the  two  and  twenty  re- 
maining invisible  emanations ;  for  Pistis  Sophia 
and  her  consort,  together  with  the  two  and 
twenty  remaining  emanations,  make  up  the  four 
and  twenty  emanations,  which  were  emanated  by 
the  great  invisible  forefather  and  the  two  great 
triple  powers."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  spoken 
these  things  unto  his  disciples,  that  Marydesir- 
Mary  came  forward  and  said  :  "  Master,  t^ehisto^ 
I  have  heard  thee  say  formerly  that  of  Sophia. 
Pistis  Sophia  was  also  one  of  the  four  and 
twenty  emanations.  How,  then,  was  she  not  in 
their  region  ?  For  thou  hast  said,  (44)  'I 
found    her   below  the   thirteenth  seon.' "

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  his  dis- 
ciples :  "It  came  to  pass,  when  sopMa  de- 
Pistis  Sophia  was  in  the  thirteenth  ter^the°^"' 
seon,  in  the  region  of  all  her  brother  ^^s^^-^^'^  •
