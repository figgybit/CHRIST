"The  word  which  thy  power  spake  through 
Solomon,  '  He  who  hath  made  me  to  descend 
from  the  lofty  regions  of  heaven,  and  who  hath, 
moreover,  made  me  enter  into  the  regions  of  the 
lower  foundation ' ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  (157)  '  I  sing  a  song  unto  thee,  0 
thou,  who,  by  thy  commandment,  hath  made 
me  come  forth  from  this  high  aeon  above  the 
heaven,  and  who  hath  led  me  into  the  lower 
regions ;  and  thou  hast  preserved  me  also  by 
thy  commandment,  thou  hast  made  me  rise  up 
from  the  lower  regions.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake 
through  Solomon,  '  Who  hath  taken  therefrom 
them  that  were  in  the  middle  region,  and  hath 
instructed  me ' ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  And  also  by  thy  commandment, 
thou  hast  caused  the   matter  w^hich  was  in  the

SECOND   BOOK.  157

midst  of  my  power  to  be  purified ;  and  I  have 
seen  it.'

"  And  also  the  word  which  thy  power  spake 
through  Solomon,  '  Who  hath  scattered  my 
enemies  and  my  adversaries ' ;  this  is  the  word 
which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  Thou  hast  scattered 
far  from  me  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  which 
constrained  me,  and  were  my  enemies.'

"  And  also  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Who  hath  given  me  wisdom  over  the  bonds  to 
unloose  them '  ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  He  hath  given  me  wisdom  to 
unloose  the  bonds  of  these  emanations.'
