"  And  I  answered  and  said  unto  her  :  '  When 
What  shall  that  gate  shall  be  opened,  all  who  are 
pa™\t°  i^  t^®  aeons  will  know  thereof,  because 
that  time,  ^f  ^-^e  great  light  which  will  stream 
into  all  their  regions,  Lo,  then,  I  have  set 
them  so,  that  none  shall  venture  any  ill  against 
thee,  until  the  three  times  are  accomplished. 
And  thou  shalt  have  the  power  of  going  into 
their  twelve  seons,  whenever  thou  mayest  wish, 
(168)  and  also  of  returning  into  thy  [own]  region, 
which  is  below  the  thirteenth  seon,  and  in  which 
thou  now  art ;  but  thou  shalt  not  have  the 
power  of  passing  through  the  gate  of  the  height, 
which  is  in  the  thirteenth  seon,  to  come  into* 
thy  region  whence  thou  didst  come  forth  [in  the 
beginning].  Moreover,  when  the  three  times 
shall  be  fulfilled,  Arrogant  and  all  his  rulers 
shall  constrain  thee,  to  take  away  the  light 
that  is  in  thee,  being  enraged  against  thee, 
thinking  that  it  is  thou  who  hast  kept  his  power 
in  chaos,  and  also  that  it  is  thou  who  didst  take 
away  the  light  which  was  in  it.  He  will  be 
enraged  against  thee  to  take  from  thee  thy 
light  and  cast  it  into  chaos,  and  give  it  to  his 
emanation,  in  order  that  it  may  have  the  power 
to  come  forth  from  chaos  and  go  into  its  own
