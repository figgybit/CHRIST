Book  II.  ends  halfway  down  page  357,  and  the  whole 
subject  abruptly  changes  with  the  heading,  "  Extnxct  from 
the  Books  of  the  Saviour."

In  addition  to  these  three  main  divisions  of  the  MS.,  two 
pages  (253-254),  with  the  same  heading,  "  Extract  from  the 
Books  of  the  Saviour,"  are  inserted  at  haphazard  in  the 
middle  of  Book  II.  They  have  no  reference  to  what  goes 
before  or  what  follows;  nor  are  they  quite  of  the  same 
nature  as  the  lengthier  Extract  at  the  end  of  the  MS.

There  is,  moreover,  a  note  which  occupies  the  last  column 
of  Book  I.,  and  which  has  not  the  slightest  reference  to  the 
rest  of  the  nai'rative ;  why  it  is  inserted  in  this  place  is   a

the  Saviour.

At  the  end  of  the  MS.,  and  after  the  conclusion  of  the 
narrative,  there  is  an  extra  leaf  which  has  only  the  left-hand 
column  partialh'  filled  with  writing.  The  subject  is  here 
again  completely  changed,  and  leads  us  to  suppose  that 
some  leaves  are  missing  before  it.

Finally,  at  page  379  eight  pages  or  four  leaves  of  the 
MS.  have  disappeared.

A  general  view  of  the  nature  of  the  subjects  treated  of 
may  be  seen  from  the  contents  table,  which  consists  of  the 
indented  summaries  I  have  added  to  the  text.
