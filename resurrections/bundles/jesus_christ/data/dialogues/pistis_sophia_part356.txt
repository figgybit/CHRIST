When,  therefore,  the  saviour  had  said  these 
words,  the  disciples  came  forward  and  cried  out 
Thedis-  all  together,  saying:  "0  saviour,  thou 
carne^  ^  excitcst  US  with  exceeding  great  frenzy 
aTthrsub-  because  of  the  transcendent  height 
theteach-  whicli  thou  hast  rcvcalcd  unto  us ; 
^^^'  and  thou  exaltest  our  souls,  and  they

have  become  paths  on  which  we  travel  to  come 
unto  thee,  (280)  for  they  came  forth  from  thee. 
Now,  therefore,  because  of  the  transcendent 
heights  which  thou  hast  revealed  unto  us,  our 
souls  have  become  frenzied,  and  they  travail 
mightily  yearning  to  go  forth  from  us  into  the 
height  to  the  region  of  thy  kingdom."

And  when  the  disciples  had  said  these  words. 
How  the  *^®  saviour  again  continued  his  con- 
shaii^^^^  versation,  and  said  unto  his  disciples  : 
preach.  a  j£  y.^  enter  into  cities,  or  princi- 
palities, or  countries,  preach  ye  first  unto  them, 
saying :  '  Seek  ye  ever,  and  cease  not,  until  ye 
have  found  the  mysteries  of  the  light,  which 
will  bring  you  unto  the  kingdom  of  light.'  Say 
unto  them,  '  Beware  of  the  doctrines  of  error,' 
for  many  shall  come  in  my  name,  saying,  '  It  is

SECOND   BOOK.  281

I,'   and  it  shall  not  be  so,  and  they  shall  lead 
astray  many.

"  Now,  therefore,  to  every  one  that  cometh 
unto  you,  and  shall  believe  in  you,  ^J^^gstw' 
and  hearken  unto  my  words,  and  act  ^^^^^  s^'^^- 
worthily  of  the  mysteries  of  light,  unto  him  shall 
ye  give  the  mysteries  of  light,  and  hide  them 
not  from  him.  Unto  him  that  is  worthy  of  the 
higher  mystery,  give  ye  thereof,  and  to  him  that 
is  worthy  of  the  lower  mystery,  give  ye  thereof, 
and  hide  nothing  from  him.
