"  This,  then,  is  the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered,  in  the  midst  of  the  four  and  twenty 
invisibles,  desiring  to  tell  them  of  all  the 
wonderful  things  which  I  had  done  with  her, 
that  they  might  know  that  I  had  descended 
into  the  world  of  men,  and  had  given  unto  them 
the  mysteries  of  the  height.  Now,  therefore, 
let  him  who  is  exalted  in  his  understanding, 
come  forward,  and  expound  the  interpretation  of 
the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia  uttered."

standing is  exalted,  and  I  have  understood  the 
interpretation  of  the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered,  and  David,  the  prophet,  prophesied 
concerning  it  of  old,  in  the  one  hundred  and

served them  from  the  hand  of  their  enemies. 
He  hath  gathered  them  together  into  their  own 
land,  from  the  east,  from  the  west,  from  the 
north,  and  from  the  sea.  They  wandered  in  the 
desert,  in  a  place  where  there  is  no  water ;  they 
found  not  the  way  to  the  city  where  was  their 
abode.  They  were  hungry  and  thirsty,  their 
soul  fainted  in  them ;  he  hath  saved  them 
from  their  constraints.  They  cried  unto  the 
lord,  and  he  hath  heard  them  in  their  danger. 
He  hath  led  them  into  a  straight  way  that  they 
might  come  to  the  place  of  their  abode.
