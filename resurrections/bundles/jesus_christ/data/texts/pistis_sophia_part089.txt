were  made,  and  mistakes  may  have  crept  in.  One  of  these 
copies  was  carried  up  the  Nile  and  translated  into  the 
vernacular,  Greek  being  but  little  understood  so  high  up 
the  river.  The  translator  was  evidently  not  a  very  accurate 
person,  as  may  be  seen  from  his  casual  insertion  of  scraps 
from  other  books  ;  moreover,  his  knowledge  of  the  subject 
was  so  superficial  that  he  had  to  leave  many  terms  in  the 
original,  and  doubtless  made  guesses  at  others.  It  is  also 
probable  that  he  added  some  things  and  subtracted  others 
on  the  score  of  orthodoxy,  as  may  be  seen  by  an  inspection 
of  the  rest  of  the  fragments  of  Valentinus.  The  wearisome 
length  of  the  Psalms,  for  instance,  which  Pistis  Sophia 
recites  in  her  repentances,  followed  by  the  shorter  excerpts 
from  the  Salomonic  Odes,  leads  one  to  suppose  that  Valen- 
tinus quoted  only  a  few  striking  verses  from  each  Psalm ; 
and  that  the  more  orthodox  translator,  with  that  love  of 
wearisome  repetition  so  characteristic  of  monkish  piety, 
added  the  other  less  apposite  verses,  with  which  he  was 
very  familiar,  while  he  was  compelled  to  leave  the  Salomonic 
Odes  as  they  stood  owing  to  his  lack  of  acquaintance  with 
the  originals.

Moreover,  the  translator  must  have  either  translated,  or 
possessed  a  translation  of.  The  Books  of  the  Saviour  and 
The  Books  of  leou.  These  were  also  most  probably  a  com- 
pilation of  Valentinus,  or  perhaps  The  Books  of  the  Saviour 
were  a  compilation  of  Valentinus  from  the  older  Books  of 
leou,  which  may  have  belonged  to  the  .Ethiopic  Euochian 
literature,  for  they  are  stated  in  the  Pistis  Sophia  (pages 
246  and  354)  to  have  been  written  down  in  Paradise  by 
Enoch,  and  preserved  from  the  Flood.
