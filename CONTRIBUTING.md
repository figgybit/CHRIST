# Contributing to The C.H.R.I.S.T. Project

Welcome! The C.H.R.I.S.T. Project is an open-source initiative to build consciousness capture and emulation systems. We believe in radical transparency, community ownership, and the power of collective intelligence.

## üéØ Mission Alignment

Before contributing, ensure your work aligns with our core principles:
- **Privacy First**: User data sovereignty is non-negotiable
- **Open Source**: All code must be freely available and modifiable
- **Ethical AI**: We build systems that augment, not replace, human agency
- **Inclusivity**: Contributions from all backgrounds are valued

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

C.H.R.I.S.T. is composed of six interconnected modules:

- **C** - Consciousness Capture (Data Ingestion)
- **H** - Holistic Self-Model (Ontology & Knowledge Graph)
- **R** - Retrieval + Reflection (Memory & Metacognition)
- **I** - Intent & Integrity (Values & Guardrails)
- **S** - Simulation Engine (Embodiment & Interaction)
- **T** - Teleology & Transformation (Purpose & Evolution)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend components)

### First-Time Contributors

1. **Find Your Focus Area**:
   - `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
   - `help wanted` - Community assistance needed
   - Component labels (`C-consciousness`, `H-holistic`, etc.) - Work on specific modules

2. **Claim an Issue**:
   - Comment on the issue you want to work on
   - Wait for assignment before starting major work
   - Ask questions! We're here to help

3. **Development Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/figgybit/CHRIST.git
   cd CHRIST
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- **Community**: Answer questions, review PRs, organize events

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Fork & Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Code Standards**:
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Use type hints where possible
   - Document all public functions/classes
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Ensure privacy-by-design principles

3. **Commit Messages**:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>

   <body>

   <footer>
   ```

   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   Scope: Component letter (C, H, R, I, S, T) or `core`, `docs`, etc.

   Example:
   ```
   feat(C): Add email parser for Gmail exports

   Implements parsing for Google Takeout mbox files with
   attachment handling and metadata extraction.

   Closes #42
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   # Component-specific tests
   pytest tests/consciousness/
   ```

5. **Pull Request**:
   - Reference related issues
   - Describe changes clearly
   - Include test results
   - Add screenshots for UI changes
   - Request review from maintainers

## üèõÔ∏è Governance

### Decision Making
- **Technical decisions**: Made through RFCs (Request for Comments)
- **Major changes**: Require community discussion and consensus
- **Emergency fixes**: Can be fast-tracked by core maintainers

### Core Maintainers
Responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging PRs
- Setting project direction
- Ensuring code quality and security
- Community moderation

### Becoming a Maintainer
- Consistent quality contributions over 6+ months
- Deep understanding of project architecture
- Commitment to project values
- Nomination by existing maintainers

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Critical Requirements
- **No hardcoded credentials** ever
- **Encryption at rest** for all personal data
- **User consent** before any data processing
- **Right to deletion** must be technically enforced
- **Audit logs** for all data access

### Reporting Security Issues
- **DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security@christproject.org with details
- Use PGP encryption if possible (key: [TBD])
- We aim to respond within 48 hours
