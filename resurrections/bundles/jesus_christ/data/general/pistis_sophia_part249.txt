"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Who  hath  smitten  the  seven-headed  serpent  in 
my  hands,  and  set  me  up  upon  his  root,  that  I 
may  blot  out  his  seed ' ;  this  is  the  word  that 
Pistis  Sophia  spake,  (158)  'Thou  hast  smitten 
the  seven-headed  serpent  by  my  hands,  and 
thou  hast  set  me  up  above  his  tribes  ;  thou  hast 
caused  it  to  perish,  so  that  its  seed  should  not 
arise  from  this  hour.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake,  '  But 
thou  wert  with  me,  helping  me ' ;  this  is  the 
word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  Thou  wert 
with  me,  giving  me  power  in  all  this  [affliction].'

"And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thy  name  hath  surrounded  me  in  every 
region '  ;  this  is  the  word   which  Pistis  Sophia

spake,  '  And  thy  light  hath  surrounded  me  in 
all  the  regions.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thy  right  hand  hath  destroyed  the  venom  of 
the  speakers  of  evils '  ;  this  is  the  word  which 
Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  And  of  thyself  thou  didst 
make  all  the  emanations  of  Arrogant  powerless  ; 
for  thou  hast  taken  from  them  their  power.'

"And  the  word  which  thy  power  hath  said, 
'  Thy  right  hand  hath  opened  the  path  for  thy 
faithful ' ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia 
spake,  '  Thou  hast  made  straight  my  path  to 
lead  me  out  of  chaos,  for  I  have  trusted  in 
thee.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thou  hast  rescued  them  from  the  tombs,  and 
thou  hast  borne  them  from  the  midst  of  the 
corpses '  ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia 
spake,  '  Thou  hast  rescued  me  from  chaos,  thou 
hast  carried  me  far  from  this  material  darkness 
(159)  which  is  the  murky  emanation  of  chaos, 
from  which  thou  hast  taken  away  the  light.'
