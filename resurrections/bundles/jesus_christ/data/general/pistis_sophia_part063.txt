INTRODUCTION.

It   is  with  somewhat   of  the  feelings  of  one  setting  forth

on    a   forlorn    hope    that  the  writer  ventures  to  „.     ^

phmge    into    the    chaos    of   syncretism    generally  ments

classified     under    the    vague    term    Gnosticism.  ^         , 
^  _  general

Indeed    no    subject    connected    with    the    history  literature

of  religion   is  fraught  with  greater  difficulty,  as    .  ^^°^^'^- 
o  o  o  ji         cism.

may  be  seen  from  the  comparative  paucity  of 
general  works  on  Gnosticism  from  the  pens  of  European 
scholars.  In  fact  the  English  reader,  outside  of  a  few 
translations,  must  content  himself  with  Burton's  Bampton 
Lectures,  Mansel's  Gnostic  Heresies,  Norton's  History  of  the 
Gnostics,  King's  Gnostics  and  their  Remains,  and  an  article 
by  Salmon.
