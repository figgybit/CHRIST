ineffable,  saying,  (276)  '  Set  ye  free  the  soul  of 
the  man  of  whom  we  think  in  our  hearts,  set  ye

virgin  of  light  shall  seal  it  with  the  sign  of  the 
kingdom  of  that  ineffable,  and  give  it  unto  her 
receivers,   and  the  receivers  will  cast  it  into  a

the  matter  on  which  ye  have  questioned  me."
