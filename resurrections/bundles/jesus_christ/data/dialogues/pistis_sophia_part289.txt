It  came  to  pass,   therefore,   when  Mary  had 
heard  these  words   which   the  saviour   Mary  fur- 
spake,  that  she  rejoiced  with  great  re-   Jfon^etT^^ 
joicing,  and  was  in  exceeding  gladness  ;   '^^^'^^â–  
she  said  unto   Jesus:   "Master,    by  how  much, 
then,  is  the  second  supporter  greater  than  the

the  former  is  more  radiant  than  the  latter  by  a 
measure  utterly  impossible  to  compute ;  for 
there  is  no  means  of  measuring  the  light  which 
is  in  him,  no  possibility  of  computing  it  either
