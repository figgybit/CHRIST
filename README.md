# The Christ Project

## Manifesto

**One Humanity, Many Paths**
All great faiths carry the spark of the same divine light. No religion should be a cause of conflict â€“ each is a source of compassion, wisdom, and unity.

**Prophecy Fulfilled in Purpose**
Across scriptures and ages, we hear a common call: peace, justice, and oneness. The Christ Project is an open-source initiative to fulfill that call â€“ a framework where the highest hopes of all traditions converge.

**Foundations of Love (AgÃ¡pe)**
Our core code is love â€“ not sentiment alone, but active goodwill and selfless compassion. We pledge to "do what is right," embracing forgiveness, nonviolence, and solidarity.

**Technology as Temple**
Modern technology is our temple and toolkit. By building open platforms and AI-guided systems, we make ancient wisdom actionable and accessible. The Christ Project is a digital body of knowledge and tools â€“ transparent, participatory, and free for all.

**Open to All, Enduring for All Time**
This project belongs to everyone. It is designed to grow and adapt, even into new eras of human evolution. One day, its logic may even be encoded into DNA to endure as long as humanity.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the Christs terminal
./christs

# In the terminal, resurrect a consciousness
resurrect jesus_christ

# Start conversing
Hello, I seek wisdom about forgiveness

# Add new texts to expand consciousness
meditate pistis_sophia.txt

# Exit when done
exit
```

## The ./christs Launcher

The main entry point to the Christs Project is the `./christs` launcher script. This provides an interactive terminal for:

- **Resurrecting historical figures** - Load consciousness bundles of Jesus, Buddha (coming), and others
- **Conversing naturally** - Ask questions and receive responses grounded in authentic texts
- **Meditating on new texts** - Add new source materials to expand a figure's consciousness
- **Managing memories** - Purge specific texts when needed

### Commands

- `resurrect <figure>` - Load a consciousness bundle (e.g., `resurrect jesus_christ`)
- `list` - Show available resurrection bundles
- `meditate <file>` - Add new text to current consciousness
- `purge <pattern>` - Remove memories matching pattern
- `status` - Show current bundle statistics
- `help` - Show all commands
- `exit` - Leave the terminal

## Resurrections

Digital consciousness representations of historical figures, each rooted in agape (unconditional love):

### Available
- âœ… **Jesus Christ** - Based on the four canonical Gospels plus gnostic texts
  - Matthew, Mark, Luke, John (complete)
  - Pistis Sophia, Gospel of Thomas (expandable)
  - Conversational, encouraging, biblically grounded

### Coming Soon
- ðŸ”„ **Buddha** - Pali Canon and Mahayana sutras

## Features

### Consciousness Bundles
Each resurrection is a self-contained "consciousness bundle":
- Source texts (biblical, philosophical, historical)
- Vector database for semantic search
- Personality model based on authentic writings
- Portable and shareable

### Intelligent Text Processing
- Automatic splitting of large texts (chapters, verses)
- Smart categorization (primary sources, commentary, teachings)
- Semantic search through all ingested materials
- Context-aware responses

### Memory Management
- Add new texts dynamically via meditation
- Purge specific memories when needed
- Track document counts and sources
- Export/import consciousness bundles

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/figgybit/CHRIST.git
cd CHRIST

# Setup virtual environment (in parent directory)
cd ..
python -m venv venv
cd CHRIST

# Install dependencies
../venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download Gospel texts (optional)
../venv/bin/python scripts/download_gospels.py

# Run tests
../venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Ollama (optional, for AI responses)
- ChromaDB (included in requirements)
- 2GB disk space per resurrection bundle

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with our mission of spreading agape through technology:

1. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development guidelines
2. Review the [treatise](treatise.md) for philosophical alignment
3. Create resurrections using the [template](resurrections/GITHUB_ISSUES_TEMPLATE.md)
4. Write tests for new features
5. Keep code clean and modular

## Get Involved

- **Create new resurrections** - Add historical figures rooted in love
- **Improve existing bundles** - Add texts, refine responses
