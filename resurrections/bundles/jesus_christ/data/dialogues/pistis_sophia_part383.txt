The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  in  the 
midst  of  his  disciples  :  "  All  those  who   of  theab- 
shall  have  received  the  mysteries  of  the   paSon  X' 
inefiable  and  also  the  mysteries  of  the   i^te^m^T 
first  mystery,  should  they  by  the  ne-   ^^'^y- 
cessity  of  the  fate  sin  no  matter  how  many  times, 
but,  while  still  in  life,  should  turn  and  repent, 
and  should  continue  each  in  his  several  mysteries, 
it  shall  be  remitted  unto  them  no  matter  how 
many  times,  for  those  mysteries  are  compassion- 
ate and  ever  give  pardon.     For  those  mysteries 
shall  not  only  remit  the  sins  which  they  shall  have 
committed   from   the  beginning,  but  they  shall 
not  impute  [sin]  to  them  henceforth  from  that 
hour,  [for]  I  have  said  unto  you  that  they  ever 
receive  repentance,  and  that  they  give  remission 
for  sins  that  are  committed  again  and  again.
