bear  witness  of  all  sins  ;  they  are  ever  in  the  judg- 
ments, seizing  the  souls,  rebuking  every  soul 
that  sinneth  and  hath  received  no  mystery  ;  they 
keep  them  in  chaos  and  chastise  them  ;  but 
these  receivers  of  wrath  cannot  go  beyond  chaos, 
so  as  to  enter  into  the  orders  which  are  higher 
than  chaos,  to  rebuke  the  souls  which  leave  those

not  received  the  mysteries  and  which  have  been 
brought  into  chaos.  But  as  for  the  souls  which 
have  received  the  mysteries,  they  have  no  need 
of  rebuking  them,  for  they  do  not  go  into  their 
regions,  and  even  if  they  should  go  into  their 
regions,  they  would  not  be  able  to  keep  them 
there  ;  least  of  all  have  they  the  power  of  taking 
them  into  chaos.

when  souls  have  committed  sin  while   How  the
