which  are  in  the  Books  of  leou,  which  I  made 
Enoch  write  clown  in  Paradise,  when  I  spoke 
to  him  from  the  tree  of  knowledge,  and  from 
the  tree  of  life,  and  which  I  made  him  deposit 
in  the  rock  of  Ararad  ;  and  I  set  Kalapatauroth, 
the  ruler  that  is  over  Skemmut,  on  wdiose  head 
is  the  foot  of  leou — the  latter  surroundeth  all 
the  seons  and  the  fate  [-sphere] — I  set  [then] 
this  ruler  to  preserve  the  Books  of  leou  from  the 
flood,  and  [also]  lest  any  of  the  rulers  out  of 
enmity  should  destroy  them.  Those  [books] 
will  I  give  unto  vou,  when  I  have  finished 
telling  you  the  emanation  of  the  pleroma."

When,  then,  the  saviour  had  thus  spoken, 
Mary  answered  and  said  :  "  Master,  what  man 
is  there  in  the  w^orld  who  hath  not  committed 
sin,  who  is  entirely  spotless  of  any  transgression? 
For  if  one  is  pure,  will  not  another  also  he  pure, 
so  as  to  find  the  mysteries  which  are  in  the 
Books  of  leou?  I,  indeed,  say  that  no  man  in 
this  world  will  be  pure  of  sin,  for  if  one  is  pure, 
then  why  should  not  another  be  pure  also  ?  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  I  tell  you  that  there  shall  be  found  one  in 
a  thousand  and  two  in  ten  thousand  for  the 
Few  only      consummation  of  the  mystery  of  the

SECOND   BOOK.  355

For  this  cause,  therefore,  I  have  torn  myself 
asunder  and  brought  the  mysteries  into  the 
world,  for  all  are  under  sin,  and  all  have  need 
of  the  boon  of  the  mysteries."
