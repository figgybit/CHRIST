hath  prophesied  of  old  through  David,  in  the 
forty -fourth  Psalm,  saying  :  '  Mercy  and  truth 
are  met  together,  righteousness  and  peace  have 
kissed  each  other.  Truth  hath  flourished  on  the 
earth,  and  righteousness  hath  looked  down  from 
heaven.'  Mercy,  therefore,  is  this  light-power 
which   was  sent  by  the  first  mystery  ;  for  the

first  mystery  had  heard  Pistis  Sophia,  (119)  he 
had  had  mercy  on  her  in  all  her  tribulations. 
Truth,  also,  is  that  power  which  issued  from 
thee,  for  that  thou  hast  fulfilled  the  truth  in 
order  to  save  me  from  chaos.  Righteousness, 
again,  is  that  power  which  was  sent  by  the  first 
mystery,  which  will  guide  Pistis  Sophia.  Peace, 
also,  is  that  power  which  issued  from  thee  to 
enter  into  the  emanations  of  Arrogant  to  take 
from  them  the  light,  which  they  had  taken  from 
Pistis  Sophia ;  that  is  to  say,  in  order  that  thou 
mightest  gather  them  together  into  Sophia,  and 
make  them  at  peace  with  her  power. '  Truth, 
also,  is  the  power  which  issued  from  thee,  when 
thou  wast  in  the  lower  regions  of  chaos.  For 
this  cause  thy  power  hath  said  through  David, 
'  Truth  hath  flourished  on  the  earth,'  for  thou 
wert  in  the  lower  regions  of  chaos.  '  Righteous- 
ness also  hath  looked  down  from  heaven ' ;  this 
is  the  power  which  issued  from  the  height,  [sent] 
by  the  first  mystery,  [the  power]  which  entered 
into  Sophia."

And  when  Jesus  had  heard  these  words,  he 
said  :  "  Well  said,  Mary,  thou  blessed  one,  who 
shalt  inhabit  every  kingdom  of  light."

Then  also  Mary,  the  mother  of  Jesus,  came 
forward,  and  said  :  "  My  Master  and  my  God, 
bid  me  also  utter  this  word  of  interpretation."

Jesus   said   unto    her :   "  He    whose    spirit   is
