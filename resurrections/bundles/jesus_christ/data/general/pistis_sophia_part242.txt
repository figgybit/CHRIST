(151)  "And  the  word  which  thy  power 
uttered,  '  Thou  wert  at  my  right  hand,  preserv-

which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  Thou  hast  been  a 
light  for  me  on  all  sides,  and  thou  hast  helped 
me.'

*'  And  the  word  which  thy  light-power  spake, 
'  Thou  hast  prevented  them  that  fought  against 
me,  and  they  did  not  show  themselves ' ;  this 
is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  And 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  which  fought  against 
me,  thou  hast  prevented  by  thy  light,  and  they 
have  not  been  able  to  draw  nigh  unto  me.'

"And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake,  *  But 
a  power  came  forth  unto  me  from  thee,  helping 
me';  (152)  this  is  again  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  And  then  the  power  of  the 
light-stream  came  forth  unto  me  from  thee, 
preserving  me.'
