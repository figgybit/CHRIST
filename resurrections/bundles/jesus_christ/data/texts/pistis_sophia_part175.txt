"  Now,  therefore,  he  whose  mind  is  exalted, 
let  him  understand."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus   had

finished  speaking  these  words  unto  his  dis- 
ciples, that  he  said  :  "  Understand  ye  how  I 
speak  ? "

And  Andrew  came  forward  and  said  :  "  Master, 
concerning  the  sixth  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia, 
thy  power  hath  prophesied  of  old  through 
David,  in  the  one  hundred  and  twenty-ninth 
Psalm,  saying  :

(75)  "  '  I  have  cried  unto  thee,  0  lord,  from 
the    depth   of  the    abyss.       Hear   my   Andrew  in- 
voice.      Let  thine  ears  give   heed   to   the^sfx^h 
the   voice   of   my  prayer.     0   lord,    if  J^'oTpsaim 
thou  remarkest  my  sins,  who  will  be   ^^^^' 
able   to  stand  ?      For  pardon  is  in  thy  hands. 
Because  of  thy  name,  I  have  waited,  0  lord.    My 
soul  hath  waited  for  thy  words ;  my  soul  hath 
trusted  in  the  lord,  from  morning  until  evening. 
Let  Israel  trust  in  the  lord  from  the  morniuo^ 
until  the  evening,  for  mercy  is  in  the  hand  of 
the  lord,  and  there  is  great  salvation  in  him  ; 
and  he  shall  redeem  Israel  from  all  his  sins.'"

Jesus  said  unto  him :    "  Well  said,   Andrew, 
thou  blessed  one.     That  is  the  inter-    ^
