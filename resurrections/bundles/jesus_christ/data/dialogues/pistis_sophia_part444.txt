ciples  continued  further  and  besought  him  : 
"  How  long,  then,  will  it  be  before  thou  shalt 
cause  the  sins  and  iniquities  which  we  have  com- 
mitted, to  be  remitted,  that  we  may  be  worthy 
of    the    kingdom    of    thy  father  ?  "

And  Jesus  said   unto    them  :  "  Amen,  I   say 
unto  you,  not  only  will  I  purify  your   jesus  pro- 
sins,  but  I  will  also  make  you  worthy   give  them 
of  the  kingdom  of  my  father  ;  and  I    of^rSnTs-^"^^ 
will  give  unto  you  the  mystery  of  the   ^^Â°"' 
remission  of  sins   on  the  earth,  so   that  he   to 
whom  ye  shall  remit  on  earth,  shall  be  pardoned 
in  the  heavens,   and  he  whom  ye  shall  bind  on 
earth,  shall  be  bound  in  the  heavens.     I  will 
give  unto  you  the  mystery  of  the  kingdom  of 
the    heavens,    that   ye    also    may  give    it  unto 
men."

and  vine  branches."

They  brought  them  unto  him.  He  set  out 
the  offering,  placing  two  vessels  of  The  mystic 
wine,  the  one  on  the  right  and  the  sa&lt;=^a^e^*^- 
other  on  the  left  thereof.  The  offering  was 
set  in  front  [of  the  vessels].  He  placed  a  cup 
of  water  in  front  of  the  vessel  of  wine  on  the 
right,  and  a  cup  of  water  in  front  of  the  vessel 
of  wine  on  the  left.  Between  the  cups  he  set 
pieces  of  bread  according  to  the  number  of  the 
disciples.     The  cups  were  behind  the  bread.

Jesus  stood  before  the  offering  and  grouped 
his  disciples  behind  him,  all  clad  in  linen  gar- 
ments, holding  in  their  hands  the  number  of 
the  name  of  the  father  of  the  treasure  of  light.
