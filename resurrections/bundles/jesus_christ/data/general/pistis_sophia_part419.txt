rulers  have  given  unto  them.  So  they  iio^y. 
seal  them.  The  day  on  which  they  took  up 
their  abode  in  the  womb  of  the  woman,  they 
seal  on  the  left  hand  of  the  plasm ;  (348)  the 
day  when  they  finished  the  body,  they  seal  on 
the  right  hand  ;  the  day  on  which  the  rulers 
handed  [the  three]  over  into  their  hands,  they 
seal  on  the  top  of  the  head  of  the  plasm  ;  the 
day    on    which    the   soul  came    forth  from  the

rulers,  they  seal  on  the  [left  side  of]  the  head  of 
the  plasm  ;  the  day  when  they  kneaded  the 
members  and  divided  them  out  for  the  soul, 
they  seal  on  the  right  side  of  the  head  of 
the  plasm  ;  the  day  on  which  they  bound  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit  to  the  soul,  they  seal 
on  the  back  of  the  head  of  the  plasm  ;  the  day 
when  the  rulers  breathed  the  power  into  the 
body,  they  seal  on  the  brain  which  is  within 
the  head  of  the  plasm,  and  also  within  the 
heart  of  the  plasm  ;  and  also  the  number  of 
years  which  the  soul  shall  pass  in  the  body, 
they  seal  on  the  forehead  of  the  plasm  ;  and 
so  they  seal  all  these  seals  on  the  plasm.  Of 
all  these  seals  I  will  tell  you  the  names  when 
I  speak  of  the  emanation  of  the  pleroma,  that 
is  to  say,  why  every  thing  hath  come  into  exist- 
ence ;  and  if  ye  would  know  it,  I  am  that 
mystery.
