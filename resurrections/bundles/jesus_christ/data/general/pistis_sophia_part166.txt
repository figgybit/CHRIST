m  the  Clay  when  1  shall  be  constramed.  fromPsaim 
Haste  thee,  and  hear  me,  in  the  day 
when  I  shall  cry  unto  thee,  for  my  days  are 
consumed  like  smoke,  (66)  and  my  bones  are 
parched  like  stone.  I  am  mowed  down  like  the 
grass,  and  my  heart  is  withered,  for  I  have  for- 
gotten to  eat  my  bread.  Because  of  the  sound 
of  my  groaning,  my  bones  have  cleaved  to  my 
flesh.  I  am  become  like  the  pelican  in  the 
wilderness ;  like  the  owl  in  a  house.  I  have 
passed  the  night  long  in  watching ;  I  am  become 
as  the  sparrow  alone  upon  the  house-top.  My 
enemies  revile  me  all  the  day  long,  and  they 
who  honoured  me,  cursed  me  ;  for  I  have  eaten 
ashes  as  though  it  were  bread,  and  mingled  my 
drink  with  tears,  before  thy  indignation  and  thy 
wrath  ;  for  thou  hast  lifted  me  up  and  cast  me 
to  the  earth.  My  days  have  declined  like  a 
shadow,  and  I  am  dried  up  like  the  grass.
