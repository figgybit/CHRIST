"  '  As  for  the  lion-faced  power,  may  the  sin 
of  him  who  sent  it  forth  before  the  light,  fall 
back  upon  him  ;  may  the  iniquity  of  the  matter 
which  it  hath  produced,  be  never  wiped  away  ; 
nay,  may  their  sin  be  ever  before  the  light ; 
may  they  never  see  beyond  [chaos] ;  may  their 
name  be  removed  from  every  region,  for  they 
have  not  spared  me  ;  (107)  they  have  constrained 
him  from  whom  they  have  taken  his  light  and 
his  power.  Moreover,  they  among  whom  I  have 
been  sent,  desired  to  take  away  my  light ; 
they  loved  to  descend  into  the  darkness ;  let

himself  with  darkness  as  with  a  girdle  of  skin 
for  ever.  Let  this  come  upon  them  that  have
