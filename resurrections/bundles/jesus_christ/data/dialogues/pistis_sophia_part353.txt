Mary  continued  and  said  :  "  Now,  then,  0 
Master,  hast  thou  not  brought  the  mys-  ^^jg^j.  ^,0^. 
teries  into  the  world  (277)  that  men  qSon^'' 
may  not  be  distressed  by  the  death  that  ^'^^^ 
shall  come  upon  them  from  the  rulers  of  the 
fate  ?  For  if  it  befalleth  any  one  to  die  by  the 
sword,  or  die  by  water,  by  tortures  and  question- 
ing and  the  violence  of  the  law,  or  by  any 
other  evil  death,  surely  hast  thou  not  brought 
the  mysteries  into  the  world  that  men  may  not 
thus  die  at  the  hands  of  the  rulers  of  the  fate, 
but  may  die  by  a  sudden  death,  and  not  be  tor- 
tured by  such  kinds  of  death  ?  For  they  are  in 
exceeding  great  number  who  persecute  us  be- 
cause of  thee,  and  multitudes  pursue  us  because 
of  thy  name,  so  that  if  we  be  submitted  to  the 
torture,  we  shall  utter  the  mystery,  that  we  may 
immediately  depart  from  the  body  without 
suffering  any  pain."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  his  disci- 
ples :  "  Concerning  the  matter  on  which   jj^^  ^^^ 
ye  question  me,  I  have  spoken  unto  you    ^ap?  ^^^ 
on  another  occasion  ;  but  hearken  once   ^^e^^^^of 
more  that   I  may   tell    it   you  again.    J^tifjjf/ 
Not   only  ye,  but  all  men  who  shall   p^^^-
