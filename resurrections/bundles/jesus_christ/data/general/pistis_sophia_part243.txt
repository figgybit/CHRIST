"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thou  hast  set  lamps  on  my  right  hand  and  on 
my  left,  so  that  no  part  of  my  being  should  be 
without  light ' ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  'Thy  power  shone  on  my  right 
and  on  my  left  hand,  surrounding  me  on  all 
sides,  so  that  no  part  of  my  being  was  without 
light.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  Thou  didst  shelter  me  under  the  shadow  of  thy 
mercy ' ;  this  is  again  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  And  thou  didst  clothe  me  in 
the  light  of  thy  stream.'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake,  '  I 
was  placed  above  the  coats  of  skin ' ;  this  is 
again  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  And 
they  have  purged  in  me  all  my  evil  matters,  and 
I  rose  superior  to  them  by  thy  light.'

152  PISTIS   SOPHIA.

through  Solomon,  '  Thy  right  hand  hath  raised 
me  up,  and  hath  taken  my  sickness  from  me '  ; 
this  is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  said,  '  And 
thy  light-stream  hath  raised  me  up  in  the  light, 
and  hath  removed  from  me  the  emanations  of 
Arrogant,  who  constrained  me.'

(153)  "  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
'  I  have  become  strong  in  thy  truth,  and  pure 
in  thy  righteousness ' ;  this  is  the  word  which 
Pistis  Sophia  spake,  '  I  became  stout  of  heart 
in  thy  light,  and  I  am  become  a  pure  light  in 
thy  light-stream.'

And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake,  '  They 
that  fought  against  me,  have  withdrawn  them- 
selves from  me ' ;  this  is  the  word  which  Pistis 
Sophia  spake,  '  And  the  emanations  of  Arro- 
gant which  constrained  me,  withdrew  them- 
selves from  me.'
