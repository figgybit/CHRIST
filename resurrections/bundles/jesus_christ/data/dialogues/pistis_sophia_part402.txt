"  But  if  they  be  sinners  who  have  passed 
from  the  body  without  repentance,  and  if  ye 
celebrate  the  mystery  of  that  ineffable  for  them, 
to  have  them  taken  out  of  every  punishment, 
and  poured  into  a  righteous  bod}'  which  shall  be 
good,  and  shall  inherit  the  kingdom  of  light,  or

even  be  set  in  the  last  order  of  the  light,  [still] 
they  will  not  be  able  [of  themselves]  to  pass 
through  the  regions,  for  they  have  not  celebrated 
the  mystery  themselves ;  but  the  receivers  of 
Melchisedec  shall  come  to  find  them,  and  shall 
bring  them  unto  the  virgin  of  light,  (330)  and 
the  workmen  of  the  judge-rulers  shall  make 
exceedino^  great  haste  to  hand  them  from  one  to 
the  other  in  turn,  until  they  bring  them  unto 
the  virgin  of  light."
