hath  made  ready  therefor  instruments  of  death. 
He  hath  created  his  arrows  to  burn  them  up. 
Behold,  injustice  hath  been  in  labour,  she  hath 
conceived  pain,  she  hath  brought  forth  mischief. 
She  hath  digged  a  pit,  she  hath  digged  it  deep. 
She  shall  fall  into  the  pit  which  she  hath 
digged ;  her  pains  shall  fall  on  her  own  head, 
and  her  injustice  on  the  midst  thereof.' "

And  when  Martha  had  uttered  these  words, 
the  first  mystery  looking  without  said  unto 
her :  "  Well  said ;  it  is  well,  Martha,  thou 
blessed  one."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had 
jgg^g  finished  narrating  to  his  disciples  all

so^hfa^  the  things  which  had  befallen  Pistis 
twrtlenth^  Sophia  whcu  she  was  in  chaos,  (176) 
*Â°^-  and  how  she  had  sung  a  song  to  the

light  until  it  had  rescued  her,  and  brought  her 
forth  from  chaos,  and  led  her  into  the  twelve 
seons,  and  also  how  she  had  been  preserved  from 
all  the  afflictions  with  which  the  rulers  of  chaos

SECOND   BOOK.  177

had  constrained  her,  because  she  had  sought  to 
go  to  the  light,  that  Jesus  continued  in  his 
conversation  and  said  unto  his  disciples :  "It 
came  to  pass,  after  these  things,  that  I  took 
Pistis  Sophia,  and  led  her  into  the  thirteenth 
aeon,  shining  most  exceedingly,  there  being  no 
measure  to  the  light  which  was  in  me.  I  entered 
into  the  region  of  the  four  and  twentieth  in- 
visible, shining  most  exceedingly.  They  were 
distressed  with  great  perturbation  ;  they  looked 
and  saw  Sophia,  who  was  with  me.  Her  they 
recognised,  but  they  knew  not  who  I  was,  they 
thought  that  I  was  some  emanation  of  the  light- 
world.
