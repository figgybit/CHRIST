out  of  the  body,  the  receivers  of  light  of  the  one 
great  triple  power,  who  is  the  great  one  among 
them,  shall  immediately  rescue  the  soul  of  that 
man  from  the  hands  of  the  receivers  of  wrath. 
Three  days  shall  they  journey  round  with  it  in 
all  the  creatures  of  the  world,  and  after  the  three 
days  they  shall  bring  it  from  above  into  chaos, 
to  pass  it  through  the  torments  of  the  j  udgments, 
that  they  may  instruct  it  in  the  torments.  (262) 
The  fires  of  chaos,  however,  will  not  trouble  it

"  And  again  with  haste  will  they  take  pity  on 
it,  to  bring  it  forth  from  the  regions  which 
belong  to  those  rulers,  and  in  like  manner  they 
will  cause  it  to  pass  through  all  the  torments.

"  They  shall  take  it  out  of  the  aeons  entirely,
