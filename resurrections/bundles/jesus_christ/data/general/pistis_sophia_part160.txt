are  ye  beyond  all  men  who  are  on  the  disciples  in 
earth,  in  that  I  have  revealed  unto  you 
these  mysteries.  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you, 
(60)  I  will  perfect  you  in  every  perfection,  from 
the  mysteries  of  the  interior  to  the  mysteries  of 
the  exterior  ;  I  will  fill  you  with  the  spirit,  so 
that  ye  shall  be  called  spiritual,  perfect  in  all 
perfections.  And,  amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you 
I  will  give  unto  you  all  the  mysteries  of  all  the 
regions  of  my  father,  and  of  all  the  regions 
of  the  first  mystery,  so  that  he  whom  ye 
shall  receive  on  earth,  shall  be  received  in  the 
light  of  the  height ;  and  he  whom  ye  shall 
reject  on  earth,  shall  be  rejected  in  the  kingdom 
of  my  father  who  is  in  the  heavens.  Hearken, 
therefore,  and  give  ear  to  all  the  repentances 
which  Pistis  Sophia  spake.  She  continued 
and  spake  her  third  repentance,  saying :

60  PISTIS   SOPHIA.

"  '  0  light  of  powers,  give  heed  and  save  me. 
â€ž,     ,    ,      Let    them    that    seek  to    take    away

The  third  -^

repentance    my    light  be  destitute,   and  let  them

of  Sophia.  J         ^

dwell  in  the  darkness.  Let  them 
that  seek  to  take  my  power  be  turned  into 
chaos,  and  let  them  be  ashamed.  Let  them 
descend  speedily  into  the  darkness,  who  constrain 
me,  saying,  "We  have  mastered  her."  But  let 
all  those  who  seek  for  the  light,  rejoice  and  be 
glad  ;  let  them  that  desire  thy  mystery,  say  ever, 
"May  the  mystery  be  exalted."  (61)  Now, 
therefore,  0  light,  preserve  me,  for  I  lack  my 
light  which  they  have  taken  away ;  and  I  am 
destitute  of  my  power  which  they  have  taken 
from  me.  Thou,  therefore,  0  light,  thou  art  my 
saviour.  'Tis  thou  who  preservest  me,  0  light. 
Haste  thee,  save  me  from  this  chaos.'  "
