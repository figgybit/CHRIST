through  the  world  of  the  rulers  of  the  midst. 
The  rulers  of  the  midst  also  inspect  the  counter- 
feit of  the  spirit  and  also  the  destiny.  The 
latter,  whose  name  is  the  destiny,  leadeth  on  a 
man  until  it  hath  him  killed  by  the  death  which 
is  destined  for  him.  This  the  rulers  of  the  great 
fate  have  bound  to  the  soul.  And  the  work- 
men of  the  sphere  bind  the  soul  with  the  power, 
with  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  and  with  the 
destiny.  And  the  whole  is  divided  so  as  to 
form  two  parts,  to  surround  the  man  and  also 
the  woman  in  the  world,  in  whom  the  sign  hath 
been  set  for  them  to  be  sent  unto  them.  (346) 
And  they  give  one  part  to  the  man  and  the 
other  to  the  woman  in  the  food  of  the  world, 
either  in  the  aery,  or  watery,  or  etheric  sub- 
stance which  they  imbibe.

"  Now,  therefore,  when  the  workmen  of  the 
rulers  have  cast  one  part  into  the  woman  and
