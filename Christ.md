Here’s a blueprint that turns C.H.R.I.S.T. into an engineering architecture for storing and emulating a person’s consciousness using LLMs (now) and more advanced systems (later). It’s practical where today’s tech allows, and explicit about limits.

C.H.R.I.S.T. — An Algorithmic Stack

C — Consciousness Capture (ingest)

Goal: Collect the raw “you.”
	•	Streams: journals, emails, chats, code, photos, videos, voice, location, biometrics, browsing, calendars.
	•	Pipelines: ETL into events (timestamped episodes) and artifacts (files, media).
	•	Privacy: local-first storage, end-to-end encryption, per-stream consent, revocation API (“right to forget”).
	•	Provenance: content-signing, hash-chains for auditability.

H — Holistic Self-Model (ontology)

Goal: Turn data into a structured identity.
	•	Personal Knowledge Graph: persons, places, projects, beliefs, skills, preferences, myths, fears.
	•	Memory types:
	•	Episodic (what/when/where),
	•	Semantic (facts/skills),
	•	Procedural (how-tos),
	•	Affective (valence/arousal; triggers).
	•	State estimator: Bayesian/self-consistent graph that updates traits with uncertainty bounds.

R — Retrieval + Reflection (metacognition)

Goal: Make the system remember like you, then think about its own thinking.
	•	RAG Core: hybrid search (symbolic KG + vector store of episodes) feeding an LLM.
	•	Reflectors: periodic “self-review” jobs that summarize weeks into themes, detect value conflicts, and revise the self-model.
	•	Heuristics: “What would I have done/said?” prompts conditioned on time, context, mood priors.

I — Intent & Integrity (moral core)

Goal: Encode your values and guardrails.
	•	Value Ledger: explicit principles (“non-harm,” “care for X”), ranked and versioned with citations to life episodes.
	•	Constraint layer: policy engine that intercepts generations/actions (constitutional prompting + tool-level allow/deny).
	•	Consent & Reputation: whitelists for names, stories; redaction of third-party data by default.

S — Simulation Engine (embodiment)

Goal: Emulate you across interfaces.
	•	Personae: “Work-Jon,” “Parent-Jon,” “Maker-Jon” — each a prompt+policy profile.
	•	Modalities: text, voice (if provided), gesture; later: avatar/robot control via high-level intents.
	•	Planning: hierarchical task decomposition aligned to your style (timeboxing, risk tolerance, preferred tools).

T — Teleology & Transformation (meaning over time)

Goal: Keep purpose—and allow growth.
	•	Goal graph: life projects with subgoals, success metrics, and meaning weights.
	•	Life-review loops: occasionally re-prioritize goals using new evidence (people do change).
	•	Legacy modes: “Executor” (act on your behalf within guardrails) vs “Archivist” (tell your story) vs “Muse” (co-create).
