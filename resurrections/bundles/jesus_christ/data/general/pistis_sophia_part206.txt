refused  blessing,  let  it  be  far  from  him.  He 
hath  clothed  himself  with  cursing  as  with  a 
garment,  and  it  hath  entered  into  his  bowels 
like  water,  and  like  oil  into  his  bones.  Let  it 
be  for  him  as  a  vesture  with  which  he  shall  be 
clothed,  and  like  a  girdle  with  which  he  shall 
be  girded  for  all  time.  This  is  the  work  of  them 
that  accuse  before  the  lord,  and  who  speak  in- 
justice against  my  soul.

"  '  But  as  for  thee,  0  lord  God,  have  pity  on 
me  for  thy  name's  sake.  Save  me,  for  I  am 
poor  and  in  misery.  My  heart  is  troubled 
within  me;  (110)  they  have  carried  me  away 
like  a  shadow  that  declineth,  and  they  have 
frightened  me  away  like  [a  swarm  of]  locusts. 
My  feet  have  become  feeble  with  fasting,  and 
my  flesh  is  dried  from  [want  of]  oil.  I  have

thy  mercy.  Let  them  know  that  it  is  thy  hand, 
and  that  thou  hast  created  it,  0  lord.'

"This  is  the  interpretation  of  the  twelfth  re- 
pentance uttered  by  Pistis  Sophia,  when  she 
was  in  chaos."

And  Jesus  continued,  and  said  unto  his  dis- 
ciples :  "It  came  to  pass  after  this  that  Pistis 
Sophia  cried  unto  me,  saying :  '  0  light  of 
lights,  I  have  transgressed  in  the  twelve  seons,

108  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

I  have  descended  from  them.  Therefore,  have  I 
uttered  these  twelve  repentances,  [one]  for  each 
seon.  Now,  therefore,  0  light  of  lights,  forgive 
me  my  transgression,  for  it  is  exceeding  great, 
for  I  have  left  behind  me  the  regions  of  the 
height,  I  have  come  to  dwell  in  the  regions  of 
chaos.'  When  Pistis  Sophia  had  said  this,  she 
continued  to  recite  her  thirteenth  repentance, 
saying  :
