erroneously  attributing  it  to  Origen.  Further  research, 
however,  demonstrated  beyond  a  doubt  that  the  autlior  was 
Hippolytus  Romauus,  Bishop  of  Ostia,  in  the  first  quarter 
of  the  third  century.  (See  Bunsen,  Hippolytus  and  His  Age, 
1852;  Dollinger,  Hippolytus  und  Kallistus,  1853,  of  which 
there  is  an  English  translation  by  Plummer  ;  and  Words- 
worth, St.  Hippolytus  and  the  Church  of  Rome,  1880,  2nd 
ed.)  As  this  treatise,  entitled  Philosophumena  or  the  Refu- 
tation of  all  Heresies,  is  by  far  the  most  important  work  on 
Gnosticism  from  the  pen  of  any  Church  Father,  owing  to 
its  lengthy  quotations  from  original  Gnostic  documents,  it 
may  be  useful  to  state  here  that  in  1859  Duncker,  after 
Schneidewin's  death,  edited  and  published  his  colleague's 
excellent  text  and  moderate  Latin  translation  at  Gottingen  ; 
in  1860  Cruice  published  a  less  reliable  text  and  Latin 
translation  at  Paris ;  and  that  the  English  reader  will  find 
a  passable  translation  by  J.  H.  Macmahou  in  the  Ante- 
Nicene  Christian  Library  entitled  The  Writings  of  Hippo- 
lytus, vol.  i.,  1868.

Curiously  enough  it  was  in  the  same  year  in  which  the 
text  of  the  Philosophumena  was  published,  1851,  that  our 
present  document,  Pistis  Sophia,  was  first  brought  into 
general  notice.
