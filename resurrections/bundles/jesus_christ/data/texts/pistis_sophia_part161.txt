It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples,  saying, 
"  This  is  the  third  repentance  of  Pis  tis  Sophia," 
that  he  said  unto  them  :  "  Let  him  in  whom  a 
perceptive  mind  is  awakened,  come  forward,  and 
let  him  expound  the  meaning  of  the  repentance 
which  Pistis  Sophia  spake."

Martha         Speaking,  that  Martha  came  forward  ;

to  speak.  and  kissed  them  ;  she  cried  aloud,  and 
wept  with   groaning    and    humbleness,   saying :

And  Jesus,  taking  Martha  by  the  hand,  said 
unto  her :  "  Blessed  is  every  one  who  humbleth 
himself,  for  on  him  they  shall  have  mercy.  Now, 
therefore,  0  Martha,  thou  art  blessed.  Expound, 
therefore,  the  interpretation  of  the  meaning  of 
the  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia."

And  Martha  answered  and  said  unto  Jesus, 
in  the  midst  of  the  disciples :  (62)  Martha  in-

by  Pistis  Sophia,  O  Jesus,  my  master,  from^Sim
