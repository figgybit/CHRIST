INTRODUCTION.  XXVll

The  characters  of  the  MS.  [P.  S.]  are  somewhat  longer  and 
more  angular,  so  that  I  take  them  to  be  older  than  both  the 
latter  MSS.,  in  which  the  letters  eta,  theta,  omicron,  rho 
and  sigma  are  much  rounder.  There  are  no  capital  letters 
in  the  whole  book  ;  the  letters  are  all  equal,  only  at  the  end 
of  the  lines  there  are  sometimes  smaller  letters  to  bring  the 
word  in.  There  are  no  other  mai-ks  of  distinction  than  a 
full  stop  or  colon.  The  Avords  are  not  separated  from  each 
other ;  the  paragraphs  are  not  distinguished  by  breaks,  but 
by  full  stops.  At  the  beginning  of  the  book,  of  the  second 
part  and  of  the  two  appendices,  the  first  letter  is  not  in 
advance  of  the  line.  If  the  paragi'aph  begins  with  the  line, 
I  have  sometimes,  though  seldom,  remai'ked  that  the  first 
letter  is  in  advance  of  the  line.  If  the  paragraph  begins  in 
the  middle  of  a  line  sometimes,  but  not  often,  the  first  letter 
of  the  following  line  is  somewhat  advanced.  Here  and 
there  also  a  section  is  noted  on  the  edge  by  a  mark  that 
looks  almost  like  a  Greek  zeta,  or  by  a  line  from  the  edge 
to  above  the  word.  If  the  paragraph  begins  at  the 
beginning  of  the  line,  the  marks  are  on  the  same  line ;  if 
it  begins  in  the  middle  of  the  line,  they  are  at  the  beginning

of  the  following  line.  The  folios  are  numbered  in  Greek 
letters."
