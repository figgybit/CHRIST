that  is  therein,  for  God  shall  save  their  soul 
from  all  matter,  and  they  shall  prepare  a  city  in 
the  light,  and  all  the  souls  that  shall  be  saved 
shall  dwell  in  that  city,  and  shall  inherit  it. 
And  the  soul  of  them  that  shall  receive  the 
mystery  shall  dwell  in  that  region,  and  they 
that  shall  have  received  the  mystery  in  its  name 
shall  dwell  therein.' "

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  spoken 
these  things  unto  his  disciples,  that  he  said  unto 
them  :  "  This  is  the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered  in  her  first  repentance,  when  she  repented 
of  her  sin,  reciting  all  things  which  had  befallen 
her.  Now,  therefore,  he  that  hath  ears  to  hear, 
let  him  hear."

And  Mary  came  forward  and  said  :  "  Master, 
my  indweller  of  light  hath  ears,  and  I  hear  in 
my  light-power,  and  thy  spirit  which  is  with 
me  is  sober.  Hearken,  therefore,  I  will  speak 
concerning  the  repentance,  (53)  which  Pistis 
Sophia  made,  speaking  of  her  sin  and  all  that 
befell  her.  Thy  light-power  hath  prophesied  of 
old  on  this  matter  through  the  prophet  David, 
in  the  sixty-eighth  Psalm,  saying  :

"  '  Save  me,  0  God,  for  the  waters  are  come
