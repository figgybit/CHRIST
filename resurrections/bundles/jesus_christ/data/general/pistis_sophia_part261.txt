order  to  constrain  Pistis  Sophia  therein.  He 
assembled  the  hosts  of  his  rulers  ;  they  pursued 
after  Pistis  Sophia  to  make  her  enter  into  the 
dark  chaos  which  [Adamas]  had  created,  and  to 
constrain  her  in  that  region,  in  order  that  the 
two  emanations  of  darkness,  which  Adamas  had 
created,  might  plague  her,  until  they  had 
taken  from  her  all  the  light  which  was  in  her, 
and  until  Adamas  should  take  the  lisrht  from 
Pistis  Sophia,  and  give  it  unto  his  two  dark  and 
malignant  emanations,  that  they  might  carry  it 
into  the  great  lower  chaos  which  is  the  darkness, 
(171)  and  cast  it  into  his  power  which  is  there, 
thinking  that  so  it  might  come  into  its  own 
region,  for  it  was  [now]  exceedingly  dark,  be- 
cause I  had  taken  from  it  its  light.

she  sang  a  song  to  the  light,  for  I  had  said  unto 
her,  '  If  thou  art  constrained,  sing  unto  me  a 
song,  and  I  will  come  in  haste  to  aid  thee.'  It 
came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  they  constrained 
her — I  was  seated  near  you  in  this  place,  that 
is  to  say,  on  the  Mount  of  Olives — that  she 
sang  a  song  to  the  light,  saying :

"  '  0  light  of  lights,  I  have  trusted  in  thee,
