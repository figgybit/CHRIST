all  the  bonds  and  all  the  seals  with  which  the 
rulers  have  bound  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  to 
the  soul  ;  and  when  the  soul  hath  uttered  the 
mystery  of  the  breaking  of  the  seals,  forthwith 
the  bonds  of  the  seals  are  broken,  which  bind 
the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  to  the  soul  within  ; 
and  when  the  soul  hath  uttered  the  mystery  of 
the  breaking  of  the  seals,  then,  forthwith,  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit  is  unbound  and  ceaseth 
to  war  against  the  soul.  In  that  hour  [then], 
the  soul  uttereth  a  mystery,  which  shall  domin- 
ate the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  and  the  destiny, 
and  suffer  them  [simply]  to  follow  after  it,  so 
that  they  have  no  strength,  while  it  hath  all

soul  and  of  the  mysteries  it  hath  received,  come 
and  wrest  that  soul  from  the  receivers  of  wrath, 
and  those  receivers  go  back  to  the  operations  of 
the  rulers  according  to  the  regulation  of  the 
leading  forth  of  souls.

"  But  the  receivers  of  that  soul,  who  pertain 
to  the  light,  become  wings  of  light  for  that  soul, 
and  will  be  a  vesture  of  light  for  it ;  they  will 
not  lead  it  into  chaos,  for  it  is  not  lawful  to  bring 
into  chaos  a  soul  that  hath  received  the  mys- 
teries ;  but  they  will  set  it  in  the  way  of  the 
rulers  of  the  midst,  and  when  it  hath  come  unto

the  rulers  of  the  midst  the  rulers  advance   to
