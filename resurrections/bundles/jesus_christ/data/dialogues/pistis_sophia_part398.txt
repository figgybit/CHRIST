And  Mary  came  forward,  she  threw  herself  at 
the  feet  of  Jesus  and  worshipped  them,  saying  : 
"  Master,  bear  with  me  if  I  question  thee,  and 
be  not  wroth  with  me  for  troubling  thee  many 
times,  for  from  this  moment  I  will  question  thee 
on  every  matter  with  precision."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  Ask  on  every  matter  that  thou  wilt,  and  I  will 
reveal  it  unto  thee  in  openness  without  parable."

Mary  answered  and  said  :  "  Again,  0  Master,
