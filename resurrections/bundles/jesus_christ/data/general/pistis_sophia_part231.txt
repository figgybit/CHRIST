"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the  light- 
stream  had  surrounded  Pistis  Sophia,  that  she 
took  courage  most  exceedingly,  and  the  stream 
ceased  not  to  surround  her  on  every  side ;  and 
Pistis  Sophia  no  longer  feared  the  emanations 
of  Arrogant,  which  were  in  chaos,  nor  did  she 
any  more  fear  that  new  power  of  Arrogant, 
which  he  had  cast  into  chaos  like  a  winged 
arrow;  (139)  nor  did  she  tremble  before  the 
dsemonial  power  of  Adamas,  which  had  come 
from  the  aeons.

"  And  again,  by  my  order,  [by  order  of]  the 
first  mystery  looking  without,  the  light-  The  trans- 
stream  which  had  surrounded  Pistis  ofSopMa. 
Sophia  on  all  sides,  became  most  exceedingly 
radiant ;  and  Pistis  Sophia  was  tabernacled  in 
the  midst  of  the  light,  a  mighty  light  being  on 
her  left  and  on  her  right,  and  on  all  sides, 
forming  a  crown  on  her  head.  And  all  the 
emanations  of  Arrogant  could  no  longer  change 
their  appearance,  nor  could  they  stand  the 
shock  of  the  great  light  of  the  stream  which 
formed  a  crown  on  the  head  of  Sophia ;  and  all 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant  collapsed,  a  host  of 
them  at  its  right,  because  of  its  mighty  radiance.

and  other  hosts  of  them  at  its  left.  They  could 
no  longer  at  all  draw  nigh  unto  Pistis  Sophia 
because  of  the  great  light ;  but  they  fell  all  one 
on  the  other,  and  could  do  no  harm  unto  Pistis 
Sophia,  because  she  had  trusted  in  the  light.
