This  startling  phenomenon  was  now  attracting  the 
attention  of  minds  which  were  not  only  skilled  in  the 
philosophy  of  the  schools,  but  also  imbued  with  the  eclectic 
spirit  of  a  universal  theosophy  and  a  knowledge  of  the 
inner  doctrines  of  the  ancient  religions.  Such  men 
thought  that  they  saw  in  the  Christian  Gospel  a  similarity 
of  doctrine  and  a  universalism  which  was  consanguineous 
with  these  inner  teachings  of  the  ancient  faiths,  and  set  to 
work  to  endeavour  to  check  the  exclusive  and  narrowing 
tendencies  which  they  saw  so  rapidly  developing  among 
the  less  instructed,  who  made  faith  superior  to  knowledge, 
even  to  such  an  extent  as  to  openly  condemn  every  other 
form  of  religion  and  scoff  at  all  philosophy  and  education.

XXIV  INTRODUCTION.

It  is  true  that  about  this  time  such  meu  arose  as  Clement 
of  Alexandria  and  Origen  who  voiced  much  more  liberal 
views  and  laid  the  foundations  of  Christian  theology,  but 
they  were  exceptions  to  the  rule.
