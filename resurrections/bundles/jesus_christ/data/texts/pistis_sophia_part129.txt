the  spheres.  J  jjj^y  question  thee  on  this  matter, 
before  that  thou  tellest  us  the  regions  whither 
thou  hast  gone."

•And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary : 
"  Speak  freely,  and  fear  not.  All  things  thou 
seekest,  I  will  reveal  unto  thee,"

Mary  said :  "  Will  all  men  who  kuow  the 
mystery  of  the  magic  of  all  the  rulers  of  all  the 
aeons  of  the  fate,  and  of  those  of  the  sphere,  in 
the  way  in  which  the  transgressing  angels  have 
taught  them ;  if  they  invoke  them  in  their 
mysteries,  that  is  to  say,  in  their  evil  magic 
rites,  to  the  hindering  of  good  deeds — will  they 
accomplish  them,  henceforth  from  this  hour,  or 
not  ? "

FIRST    BOOK.  29

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary : 
"  They  will  not  accomplish  them  as  j^g^g  ^^ 
they  accomplished  them  from  the  be-  fj^her'the 
ginning,  for  I  have  taken  from  them  1^^^^^^°^ 
the  third  of  their  power ;  but  they  spheres. 
will  make  use  of  those  who  know  the  mysteries 
of  the  magic  of  the  thirteenth  aeon  ;  (30)  they 
will  accomplish  them  perfectly  and  at  their 
ease,  for  I  have  not  taken  away  the  power  in 
that  region,  according  to  the  command  of  the 
first  mystery."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
saying  these  words,  that  Mary  insisted  further, 
and  said :  "  Master,  surely  the  ordainers  of  the 
hour,  and  diviners,  will  no  more  tell  men  what 
will  come  to  pass,  henceforth  from  this  hour  ? "
