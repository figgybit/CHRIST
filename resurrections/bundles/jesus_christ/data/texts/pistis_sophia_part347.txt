"  [Even]  if,  after  ye  have  once  given  him  [of 
the  mysteries]  of  the  second  space  or  of  the  third, 
he  should  return  again  to  his  transgression, 
[nevertheless]  ye  shall  again  give  them  unto  him 
a  second  time,  and  also  a  third  time  ;  but  if  he 
still  transgress,  ye  shall  no  longer  give  him  them,

SECOND   BOOK.  271

for  then  these  mysteries  shall  be  witnesses 
against  him  in  his  last  repentance.  Amen,  I 
say  unto  you,  he  who  shall  give  the  mysteries 
again  unto  such  a  man  in  the  second  or  in 
the  third  space,  is  subject  to  a  great  judgment. 
But  let  that  man  be  for  you  as  a  transgressor 
and  a  stumbling-block.

"  Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  for  the  soul  of  that 
man  there  is  no  salvation  in  the  world  from  that 
hour;  (271)  his  habitation  shall  be  in  the  midst 
of  the  jaws  of  the  dragon  of  outer  darkness,  the 
place  of  weeping  and  gnashing  of  teeth,  and 
in  the  dissolution  of  the  world,  his  soul  shall 
be  frozen  up,  and  shall  be  lost  in  the  pitiless  ice 
and  inexorable  fire,  and  shall  cease  to  exist  for 
the  eternity.

"  Even  should  he  again  repent  and  renounce 
the  whole  world,  all  its  interests,  and  all  its  sins, 
and  be  in  severe  penitential  discipline  and  great 
contrition,  [nevertheless]  no  mystery  shall  accept 
his  repentance,  none  shall  give  ear  unto  him  to 
accept  his  repentance,  and  grant  him  the  remission 
of  his  sins,  save  only  the  mystery  of  the  first 
mystery  and  the  mystery  of  that  ineffable.  These 
alone  will  accept  repentance  from  such  a  man, 
and  grant  him  the  remission  of  his  sins,  for  these 
mysteries  are  compassionate  and  merciful- 
minded,  and  grant  remission  of  sins  at  any 
time."
