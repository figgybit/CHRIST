"Great,  therefore,  were  my  hopes  in  1842,  that  the 
ancient  Coptic  manuscript  of  the  British  Museum,  inscribed 
Sophia,  might  be  a  translation,  or  at  least  an  extract,  from 
that  lost  text-book  of  Gnosticism  [the  work  quoted  by 
Hippolytus,  sub  Valent.]  :  but  unfortunately  the  accurate 
and  trustworthy  labours  of  that  patient  and  conscientious 
Coptic  scholar,  Dr.  Schwartze,  so  early  taken  away  from 
us,  have  proved  to  me  (for  1  have  seen  and  perused  his 
manuscript,  which  I  hope  will  soon  appear),  that  this 
Coptic  treatise  is  a  most  worthless  (I  trust,  purely  Coptic) 
oftshoot  of  the  Marcosian  heresy,  of  the  latest  and  stupidest 
mysticism  about  letters,  sounds,  and  words."  Bunsen 
stands  absolutely  alone  in  this  opinion,  and  we  doubt 
whether  he  could  have  read  Schwartze's  MS,  with  any  care.

xl  INTRODUCTION.

k.  1853.  Baur  (F.  C).  Das  Christenthuiii  und  die  clirisLliche 
Kirche  der  drei  ersten  JahiLuuderte  (Tubingen) â€” 
notes  on  pp.  185,  186,  and  205,  206.

Baur  evidently  added  these  notes  at  the  last  moment 
before  publication.  On  page  206  n.,  he  leans  to  the  idea 
of  an  Ophite  origin.

/.  1854.  Kostlin  (K.  R.).  Two  articles  in  Baur  and  Zeller's 
Theologische  Jabrbucher  (Tubingen),  xiii.  1-104  and 
137-196;  entitled  "Das  gnostisclie  System  des 
Bucbes  Pistis  Sophia."

Kostlin  was  the  first  to  make  an  exhaustive  analysis  of 
the  contents  of  the  treatise,  and  his  labours  are  used  by 
Lipsius  in  his  article  in  Smith  and  Wace's  Dictionarj'  of 
Christian  Biography.  He  assigns  its  date  to  the  first  half 
of  the  third  century,  and  assumes  that  it  is  of  Ophite 
origin.

In  a  note  to  page  1,  Kostlin  writes  :
