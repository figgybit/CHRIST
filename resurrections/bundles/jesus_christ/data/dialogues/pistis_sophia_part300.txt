spoken,  that  they  were  cast  down  and  courage, 
lost  courage  entirely.  Mary  Magdalene  came 
forward,  she  bowed  herself  at  the  feet  of  Jesus, 
and  worshipped  them  ;  she  cried  aloud  and  wept, 
saying :  "  Have  mercy  upon  me.  Master ;  for 
liave  not  my  brethren  heard  and  lost  all  courage 
because  of  the  words  which  thou  hast  spoken  ? 
Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  concerning  the  gnosis 
of  all  the  things  which  thou  hast  said  are  in  the 
mystery  of  that  ineffable,  (217)  I  heard  thee  say, 
''  Henceforth  from  this  time  I  shall  begin  to  tell 
unto  you  the   entire  gnosis  of  this  mystery   of

216  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

that  ineffable ' â€” well  then,  as  to  these  words  thou 
hast  not  brought  us  to  a  perfect  understanding 
thereof.  Wherefore  my  brethren  have  heard ; 
they  have  lost  courage,  they  have  ceased  to 
sense  the  meaning  of  thy  speech,  and  [that]  be- 
cause of  the  words  thou  hast  employed.  Now, 
therefore,  0  Master,  if  the  gnosis  of  all  these 
things  is  in  that  mystery,  who  is  the  man  in  this 
world  who  shall  be  able  to  understand  that 
mystery  and  all  its  gnoses,  and  the  fashion  of  all 
the  words  which  thou  hast  spoken  concerning  it? '"
