"  '  I  have  been  rescued  from  chaos  ;  I  have 
been  loosed  from  the  bonds  of  dark-  sophia 
ness.  I  have  come  unto  thee,  0  light,  f^^^f^  ^ 
for  thou  hast  been  for  me  light  on  all  p^^^^Â®- 
sides,  preserving  and  helping  me.  And  the  ema- 
nations of  Arrogant,  which  fought  against  me, 
thou  hast  kept  therefrom  by  thy  light,  and  they 
have  not  been  able  to  draw  nigh  unto  me ;  for 
thy  light  was  with  me  and  preserved  me  through 
thy  light-stream,  because  the  emanations  of 
Arrogant  constrained  me,  they  took  away  my 
power,  and  cast  me  into  chaos  deprived  of  my 
light,  and  I  became  as  gross  matter  before  them. 
Then  came  forth  the  power  of  the  light-stream 
unto  me  from  thee  to  save  me  ;  it  shone  on  my 
left  and  on  my  right,  surrounding  me  on  all 
sides,  so  that  no  part  of  my  being  was  without 
light,  and  thou  didst  hide  me  in  the  light  of  thy 
stream.  Thou  didst  purge  in  me  all  my  evil 
matters,  and  I  rose  superior  to  all  my  matters, 
because  of  thy  light  and  of  thy  light-stream, 
which  hath  raised  me  up,  and  hath  kept  far  from

me  the  emanations  of  Arrogant  which  constrained 
me.  (149)  I  became  stout  of  heart  in  thy  light, 
and  in  the  pure  light  of  thy  stream.  And  the 
emanations  of  Arrogant  which  constrained  me 
withdrew  themselves  from  me,  and  I  became 
radiant  in  thy  great  power.  Thou  hast  saved 
me  and  hast  preserved  me  for  ever.'

"  This  is  the  repentance  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered,  when  she  came  forth  from  chaos  and 
was  freed  from  the  bonds  of  chaos.  Now, 
therefore,  he  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him 
hear."
