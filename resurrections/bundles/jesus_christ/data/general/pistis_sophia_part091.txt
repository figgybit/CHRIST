In  presenting  the  following  translation  to  the  English- 
reading  public,  I  may  say  that  I  should  not  have  The 
ventured  on  such  an  undertaking  if  any  Coptic  t^ansla- 
scholar  had  undertaken  the  task,  or  I  had  heard  apolo- 
that  such  a  task  was  contemplated.  In  a  matter  8^^' 
of  such  difficulty  every  possible  liability  to  error  should  be 
eliminated,  and  it  stands  to  reason  that  the  translation  of  a 
translation  must  needs  be  but  an  apology  for  a  first-hand 
version.  Nevertheless  I  am  not  without  predecessors.  The 
Coptic  MS.  itself  is  in  the  first  place  a  translation,  so  that 
even  Coptic  scholars  must  give  us  the  translation  of  a 
translation.  I  am  persuaded  also  that  the  anonymous  and 
imperfect  French  translation  in  the  Appendix  to  Migne's 
Dictionnaire  des  Apocryphes  (vol.  i.)  is  made  from  Schwartze's 
Latin  version  and  not  from  the  Coptic  text.  C.  W.  King 
in  his  Gnostics  and  their  Kemains  has  also  translated  a 
number  of  pages  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  from  Schwartze. 
Some  three  or  four  years  ago  Mr.  Xutt,  King's  publisher, 
sent  out  a  notice  for  the  publication  of  the  whole  of  King's 
translation,  but  the  project  fell  through.  Last  year  I 
oflFered  to  edit  this  translation  of  King's,  but  was  informed 
that  the  literary  legatee  of   the   deceased   scholar  was  of

the  opinion  that  it  would  be  unfair  to  his  memory  to  publish 
a  MS.  that  was  in  so  incomplete  a  condition.
