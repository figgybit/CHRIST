supporter  breathed  into  the  mixture,  which 
[power]  was  blended  with  all  the  invisibles  and 
rulers,  and  all  the  aeons.  Once  only  was  it  blended 
with  the  world  of  destruction,  which  is  the  mix- 
ture. This  [power]  I  brought  out  from  myself 
from  the  beginnino; ;  I  cast  it  into  the  first 
statute,  and  the  first  statute  cast  a  portion 
thereof  into  the  great  light,  and  the  great  light 
cast  a  portion  of  that  which  it  received  into  the 
five  supporters,  and  the  last  supporter  took  a 
portion  of  that  w^hich  it  received,  and  cast  it 
into  the  mixture.  (15)  And  this  [powder]  dwelleth 
in  all  those  who  dwell  in  the  mixture,  in  the 
manner  in  which  I  have  just  told  you."
