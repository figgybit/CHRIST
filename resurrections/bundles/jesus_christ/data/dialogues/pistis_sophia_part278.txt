and  said  :  "  Master,  will  the  men  of  this  world, 
who  have  received  the  mysteries  of  light,  (188) 
be  higher  than  the  emanations  of  the  treasure 
in  thy  kingdom  ?  For  I  have  heard  thee  say, 
'  When  I  shall  have  brought  you  to  the  region 
for  receiving  the  mysteries,  the  region  of  the 
light- world  will  seem  to  you  like  a  speck  of  dust^ 
because  of  the  great  distance  that  it  will  be 
[from  you],  and  because  of  the  great  light  which 
is  in  it ' â€” [far  greater  than  that  of]  the  world 
of  the  treasure  of  light,  the  region  in  which 
are  the  emanations.  Will,  then,  my  Master, 
the  men  who  shall  have  received  the  mysteries, 
be  higher  than  the  light- world,  and  will  they 
be  any  higher  than  them  in  the  kingdom  of 
light  ? "

Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  :  "  Ex- 
cellently, indeed,  dost  thou  question  concerning 
every  matter  with  earnestness  and  confidence. 
But  hearken,  0  Mary,  that  I  may  explain  unto 
thee  the  completion  of  the  aeon  and  the  ascension

this,  had  I  not  said  unto  you,  '  When  I  shall 
have  brought  you  into  the  region  of  the  in- 
heritances of  those  who  shall  have  received  the 
mystery  of  the  light  of  the  treasure  of  light, 
(189)  the  region  of  the  emanations  shall  seem 
to  you  like  a  speck  of  dust,  and  like  the  simple 
light  of  the  day  sun.'
