of  weakness  and  strength,  of  sickness  Marycon- 
and  health,  in  a  word  because  of  all  q^^^'stion^"' 
things  of  this  kind,  so  that  when  ^'^s- 
we  come  into  the  regions  of  a  country,  and 
they  do  not  believe  in  us  or  give  ear  to  our 
words,  we  should  perform  these  mysteries  in 
those  regions,  in  order  that  they  may  know 
truly  that  we  preach  the  words  of  the  perfec- 
tion ?  "

(279)  The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto 
Mary  in  the  midst  of  the  disciples :  "  The 
mystery  on  which  ye  question  me,  [behold]  I' 
gave  it  unto  you  on  another  occasion  ;  but  I 
will  answer  again  and  explain  unto  you  the 
matter.

"  Now,  therefore,  0  Mary,  not  only  ye,  but  all 
men  who  shall  achieve  the  mystery  of  '^^^  ^^^^^ 
the   resurrection    of    the   dead    which   fesurrec-

sufferings  and  every  disease,  [which  also  healeth] 
the  blind,  the  lame,  the  halt,  the  dumb,  and  the 
deaf,  [the  mystery]  which  I  gave  unto  you  afore- 
time— whosoever  shall  receive  of  these  mysteries 
and  achieve  them,  if  he  ask  for  anything  what- 
ever hereafter,  poverty  or  riches,  weakness  or 
strength,  disease  or  health,  or  the  whole  healing 
of  the  body,  and  the  resurrection  of  the  dead, 
the  power  of  healing  the  lame,  the  blind,  the  deaf

and  the  dumb,  of  every  disease  and  every 
suffering — in  a  word,  whosoever  shall  achieve 
this  mystery,  if  he  ask  any  of  the  things  which 
I  have  just  told  unto  you,  they  shall  at  once  be 
granted  unto  him."
