hath  come  into  the  region  of  the  rulers  of  the 
way  of  the  midst,  then  they  advance  to  meet  it  in 
exceeding  great  terror,  and  the  soul  presenteth 
the  mystery  of  fear  unto  them,  and  they  are  in 
terror  before  it  ;  it  dismisseth  the  destiny  to  its 
own  region  and  dismisseth  the  counterfeit  of  the 
spirit  to  its  own  region,  and  it  presenteth  their 
apology  and  seals  to  each  of  the  rulers  who  are 
in  the  ways,  and  profFereth  the  honour  and  glory 
and  worship  of  the  seals,  and  its  songs  to  all 
them  of  the  region  of  light ' — concerning  this 
word,  0  Master,  thou  didst  say  unto  us  afore-

received  the  mysteries  giveth  apology  in  every 
region.  This,  0  Master,  is  the  second  intuition. 
"  The  third  intuition  is  concerning  the  word 
which  thou  hast  just  now  spoken  unto  us,  '  The 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit  is  the  enemy  of  the  soul, 
and  constraineth  it  to  commit  every  kind  of  sin 
The  foes  of  and  mischicf,  and  rebuketh  it  in  the 
house.  torments  because  of  all  the  sins  which

it  hath  caused  it  to  commit ;  in  a  word,  it  is  the 
foe  of  the  soul  in  every  way ' — concerning  this
