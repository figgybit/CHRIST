"  The  word,  then,  which  thy  power  spake, 
through  David,  '  Who  dwelleth  under  the  de- 
fence of  the  most  high  shall  abide  under  the 
shadow  of  the  God  of  heaven ' ;  that  is,  when 
Sophia  trusted  in  the  light,  she  abode  under  the 
light  of  the  light-stream  which  came  down  from 
the  height  from  thee.

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  uttered, 
through  David,  '  I  will  say  unto  the  lord,  "  Thou

hast  received  me  unto  thyself,"  and  my  place  of 
refuge  is  my  God,  in  whom  I  have  trusted';  this 
is  the  word  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake  in  her 
song,  (143)  'Thou  hast  received  me  unto  thyself, 
and  I  was  going  unto  thee.'

"  And,  again,  the  word  which  thy  power 
uttered,  '  My  God,  I  trusted  in  thee  ;  for  thou 
shalt  save  me  from  the  snares  of  the  hunters,  and 
from  them  that  utter  violent  words ' ;  this  is 
what  Pistis  Sophia  said,  '  0  light,  I  have 
trusted  in  thee  ;  for  thou  shalt  save  me  from 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant  and  from  those  of 
tyrant  Adamas  ;  thou,  moreover,  shalt  save  me 
from  all  their  violent  threats.'

"And,  again,  the  word  which  thy  power 
spake  through  David,  '  He  shall  shelter  thee 
under  his  breast,  and  thou  shalt  take  courage 
beneath  his  wings,'  meaneth  that  Pistis  Sophia 
hath  dwelt  in  the  light  of  that  light-stream 
which  came  forth  from  thee,  and  she  was  as- 
tonished in  heart  by  the  light  which  was  on  her 
left,  and  that  which  was  at  her  right,  that  is  to 
say,  the  wings  of  the  light-stream.

"  And  the  word  which  thy  light-power  pro- 
phesied through  David,  '  Truth  shall  surround 
thee  like  a  breast-plate ' ;  that  is,  the  light 
of  the  light- stream  which  surrounded  Pistis 
Sophia  like  a  breast-plate.

"And   the   word    which    thy    power   uttered,
