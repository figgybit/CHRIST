find,  and  to  whomsoever  knocketh,  it  shall  be 
opened.'  Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  from  whom 
shall  we  seek,  or  at  whose  door  shall  we  knock  ? 
Who  hath  the  power  to  give  out  the  revelation 
of  the  words  on  which  we  question  thee  ?  (182) 
Who  knoweth  the  power  of  the  words  concern- 
ing which  we  make  the  questioning  ?  For  'tis 
thou  who  has  given  us  in  our  minds  a  mind 
of  light ;  thou  hast  given  unto  us  the  highest 
perception  and  conception.  Therefore,  is  there 
no  one  in  the  world  of  men,  there  is  no  one  in 
the  height  of  the  aeons,  who  can  give  out  the 
revelation  of  the  words  on  which  we  make  our 
questionings,  save  thee  alone,  who  knowest  all, 
who  art  perfect  in  all ;  for  I  put  not  my  ques- 
tions like  the  men  of  the  world,  but  we  seek  in 
the  science  of  the  height,  which  thou  hast  given 
unto  us  ;  and  we  frame  our  questions  on  the 
type  of  the  excellent  questioning  which  thou 
hast  taught  us,  that  we  might  frame  our  ques- 
tions thereon.  Now,  therefore,  Master,  be  not 
wroth  with  me,  but  reveal  unto  me  the  matter 
on  which  I  question  thee."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard  the 
words  which  Mary  Magdalene  had  spoken,  that 
he  answered  and  said  unto  her  :  "  Ask  what  thou 
wilt,  and  I  will  reveal  it  unto  thee  with  earnest- 
ness and  confidence.  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto 
you,    rejoice    with   great    rejoicing,    and    be    in

exceeding  great  gladness,  questioning  me  con- 
cerning everything  with  diligence  ;  and  I  shall 
be  in  exceeding  great  gladness,  because  ye  ques- 
tion me  on  every  matter  with  earnestness,  and 
that  ye  question  in  the  manner  in  which  ye 
ought  to  question.  Now,  therefore,  ask  what 
thou  wilt,  and   I   will   reveal  it  unto  thee  with

joy."
