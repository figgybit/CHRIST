their  mouths  against  me ;  they  have  Â°^  Sophia, 
acted  with  deceit  towards  me ;  they  have  sur- 
rounded me,  seeking  to  take  away  my  power, 
and  they  have  hated  me,  because  I  sang  a  song 
unto  thee ;  instead  of  loving  me,  they  have 
accused  me  ;  as  for  me,  I  sang  a  song.  They 
have  plotted  together  to  take  my  power,  because 
I  sang  to  thee  a  song,  0  light ;  and  they  hated 
me,  because  I  loved  thee.  Let  darkness  fall  on 
Arrogant,  and  may  the  ruler  of  the  outer  dark- 
ness remain  at  his  right  hand.  When  thou 
passest  sentence  upon  him,  take  from  him  his 
power,  and  that  which  he  thought  to  do  unto 
me,  in  taking  away  my  light,  [do  thou  unto 
him,]  and  take  away  his.  May  all  the  light- 
powers  which  are  in  him,  cease;  (106)  and  may 
another  take  his  greatness  among  the  three 
triple  powers ;  may  all  the  powers  of  his  ema- 
nations be  without  light, "  and  may  his  matter 
have  no  light  in  it ;  suffer  them  not  to  enter  into 
their  region.  May  their  light  cease  in  them ; 
may  they  not  be  allowed  to  enter  into  the  thir- 
teenth seon,  their  region.  Let  the  receiver,  the 
purifier  of  lights,  purify  all  the  light-powers  that 
are  in  Arrogant,  and  take  them  from  them.  May 
the  rulers  of  lower  darkness  have  power  over  his 
emanations.     Let  no  one  receive  them  into  his

region ;  let  no  one  give  ear  to  the  power  of  his 
emanations  which  are  in  chaos.  Let  them  take 
away  the  light  which  is  in  his  emanations,  and 
let  them  hide  their  name  in  the  thirteenth  aeon ; 
aye,  let  them  blot  out  his  name  for  ever  in  that 
region.
