"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  all  the  inde- 
structibles  in  their  twelve  orders  rent  themselves 
asunder,  and  why  they  were  set  in  a  single 
order,  emanating  one  after  the  other,  and  why 
they  were  divided  and  formed  separated  orders, 
being  also  uncontainable  impassables,  and  why 
they  emanated  from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  impassables 
rent  themselves  asunder,  and  why  they  emanated 
from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  impassables 
rent  themselves  asunder,  and  why  they  were 
formed  into  twelve  impassable  spaces,  and  were 
set  in  three  orders  of  spaces,  according  to  the 
regulation  of  the  one  and  only  inefiable,  and 
why  they  emanated  from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  twelve  un- 
containables  w^hich  belong  to  the  orders  of  the 
one  and  only  ineffable,  (222)  rent  themselves 
asunder,  and  why  they  emanated  from  the  parent- 
less, until  they  reached  the  space  of  the  first 
mystery  which  is  the  second  space,

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  four  and 
twenty  myriads  of  the  laudables  rent  themselves 
asunder,  and  why  they  separated  beyond  the 
veil  of  the  first  mystery,  which  is  the  twin 
mystery,  looking  within  and  without,  of  the 
one  and  only  ineffable,  and  why  they  also 
emanated  from  the  parentless.

SECOND   BOOK.  221

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  all  the  uncon- 
tainables  which  I  have  just  enumerated — they 
which  are  in  the  regions  of  the  second  space  of 
the  ineffable,  that  is  to  say,  the  space  of  the 
first  mystery — why  they  rent  themselves  asun- 
der, and  why  these  uncontainables  and  im- 
passables  emanated  from  the  parentless.
