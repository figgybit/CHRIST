"  Wherefore,  my  disciples,  grieve  not,  thinking 
that  ye  will  never  understand  that  mystery. 
Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  that  mystery  is  far  simpler 
to  understand  than  all  mysteries ;  and  amen,  I 
say  unto  you,  that  mystery  is  yours  and  also  his 
whosoever  shall  renounce  the  whole  world  and 
all  the  matter  that  is  therein.

"  Now,  therefore,  hearken,  0  my  disciples,  my 
friends  and  my  brethren,  that  I  may  impel  you 
to  the  understanding  of  that  mystery  of  the  in- 
effable. (219)  These  things  I  say  unto  you, 
because  I  have  already  instructed  you  in  every 
gnosis  in  the  emanation  of  the  pleroma ;  for  the 
emanation  of  the  pleroma  is  its  gnosis.

"  Now,  therefore,  that  I  may  speak  with  you 
further  for  your  understanding  of  these 
mysteries.
