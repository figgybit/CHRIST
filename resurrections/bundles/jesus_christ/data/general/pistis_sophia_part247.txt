" '  He   who  hath  made  me  to  descend  from 
the  lofty  regions  of  heaven,  (156)  and   Matthew 
who  hath  led  me  into  the  regions  which   eth^the^ 
are  in  the  lower  foundation  ;  who  hath    gophia 
taken  therefrom  them  that  were  in  the   oaS  o*f  ^ 
middle  region,  and  who  hath  instruct-   Solomon. 
ed  them ;  who  hath  scattered  my  enemies  and 
my    adversaries ;    who    hath    given    me    power 
against  the  bonds  to  unloose   them  ;  who  hath 
smitten  the  seven-headed  serpent  in  my  hands, 
and  set  me  up  upon  his  root,  that  I  may  blot 
out  his  seed â€” he  is  thyself  who  wert  with  me, 
and   helped   me   in    every    region.     Thy   name 
hath    surrounded    me ;    thy    right    hand    hath 
destroyed  the  venom  of  the   speaker  of  evils ; 
thy  right  hand  hath  opened  the  path  for  thy 
righteous ;    thou   hast    preserved    them   in    the 
tombs,  and  hast  borne  them  from  the  midst  of 
the  corpses.     Thou  hast  taken  dead  bones,  and 
hast  clothed  them  with  a   body,  and  to  them

that  stirred  not  thou  hast  given  the  energy  of 
life.  Thy  way  is  void  of  destruction,  and  so 
also  thy  countenance.  Thou  hast  led  thine  aeon 
into  destruction,  that  all  might  be  destroyed 
and  be  again  renewed,  and  that  thy  light  might 
become  a  foundation  for  them  all.  Thou  hast 
poured  out  thy  wealth  upon  them,  and  they 
have  become  a  holy  place.'

"  This  is  the  interpretation,  0  Master,  of  the 
song  which  Pistis  Sophia  uttered.  Hearken, 
therefore,  that  I  may  expound  it  openly.
