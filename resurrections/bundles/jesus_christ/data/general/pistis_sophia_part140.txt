"  But  when  I  had  taken  away  the  third  part 
of  their  power,  I  changed  their  re-  They  no 
volution,  so  that  for  a  period  they  Se'^powJr 
faced  the  left,  and  for  another  period  °ng^^their" 
they  faced  the  right;  I  changed  the  ™a"e''- 
whole  of  their  path  and  the  whole  of  their 
course,  and  I  caused  the  path  of  their  course  to 
be  hastened,  so  that  they  might  be  quickly 
purified,  and  they  might  speedily  rise.  And  I 
shortened  their  circles,  and  I  caused  their  path 
to  be  lightened,  and  they  were  greatly  hurried, 
and  were  thrown  into  confusion  in  their  path  ; 
and  from  that  hour,  they  have  no  more  had  the 
power  of  devouring  the  matter  of  the  purgation 
of  the  brilliancy  of  their  light.  Moreover,  their 
times  and  their  periods  were  shortened,  in  order 
that  the  perfect  number  of  souls  who  shall  re- 
ceive the  mysteries,  and  dwell  in  the  treasure  of 
light,  should  be  speedily  completed.  For  had  I 
not  changed  their  course,  had  I  not  shortened 
their  times,  they  would  not  have  permitted  any 
soul  to  come  into  the  world,  because  of  the  matter 
of  their  purgation,  which  they  devoured,  (40) 
and  they  would  have  destroyed  a  host  of  souls. 
For  this  cause  I  said  unto  you  before,  '  I  have 
shortened  the  times  because  of  my  elect,'  for 
there  would  not  have  been  a  soul  that  could 
have  been  saved,  if  I  had  not  shortened  the 
times  and  the  periods,  because   of  the  perfect
