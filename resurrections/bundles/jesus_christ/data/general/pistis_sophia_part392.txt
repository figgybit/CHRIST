through  the  cycles  of  transmigrations  of  body 
and  come  back  into  the  world  in  those  days ; 
and  amons^  them  shall  be  some  who  are  now 
alive  and  hear  me  teach  concerning  the  con- 
summation of  the  number  of  perfect  souls,  [and 
in  those  days]  they  shall  find  the  mysteries  of 
light,  and  shall  receive  them.  They  shall  mount 
up  to  the  gates  of  the  light,  and  shall  find  that 
the  number  of  perfect  souls  is  complete,  which  is 
the  consummation  of  the  first  mystery  and  the 
gnosis  of  the  pleroma ;  they  will  find  that  1  have 
shut  the  gates  of  the  light,  and  that  from  that 
hour  no  one  can  come  in  or  go  forth  thereby.

ye  are.'  And  they  will  say  unto  me,  '  We 
have  received  the  mysteries,  and  we  have 
fulfilled  all  thy  doctrine ;  thou  didst  teach  us 
on  the  high  ways.'  And  I  will  answer  unto 
them  saying,  '  I  know  not  who  ye  are,  ye  who 
have  practised  iniquity  and  evil  even  unto  this 
day.  Wherefore  go  [hence]  into  the  outer 
darkness.'  (319)  Forthwith  they  will  depart  to 
the  outer  darkness,  where  there  is  weeping  and 
gnashing  of  teeth.

"  For  this  cause,  therefore,  preach  ye  to  the 
whole  world,  saying,  '  Strive  ye  together ;  re- 
nounce the  whole  world  and  all  the  matter 
therein  ;  receive  the  mysteries  of  light  before 
the  number  of  perfect  souls  is  completed, 
that  ye  may  not  be  left  before  the  gates 
of  the  light  and  sent  away  into  the  outer 
darkness.'

"  Now,  therefore,  he  that  hath  ears  to  hear, 
let  him  hear."
