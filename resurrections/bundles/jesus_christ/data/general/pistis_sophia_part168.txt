set  her  free  from   chaos.     It  came  to 
pass,  therefore,  when  the  material  emanations  of 
Arrogant   constrained   her,  that   she    cried   out 
reciting  this  fifth  repentance,  saying  :

"  '  Light  of  my  salvation,  I  send  forth  a  song 
unto  thee  in  the  region  of  the  height,  and   The  fifth

song  which  I  sang  in  the  height ;  which  I  have 
sung  too  in  chaos.  Let  it  come  into  thy 
presence.  Give  heed,  0  light,  to  my  repent- 
ance, (68)  for  my  power  is  filled  with  darkness, 
and  my  light  hath  come  into  chaos.  I  am 
become,  also,  like  as  the  rulers  of  chaos,  they 
who  go  into  the  lower  darkness.  I  have  become 
as  a  material  body,  which  hath  no  one  to  save  it  in

which  the  power  hath  been  taken  ;  [matter]  cast 
into  chaos,  which  thou  hast  not  preserved, 
which  hath  perished  by  thy  commandment.

darkness  ;  in  darkness,  and  in  dead  matter,  in 
which  there  is  no  power.  Thou  hast  brought 
thy  commandment  upon  me,  and  upon  every- 
thing as   thou  hast   decreed.     Thy  spirit  hath

departed,  and  left  me.  Moreover,  by  thy  com 
mandment,  the  emanations  of  my  aeon  have  not 
come  to  my  aid.  They  have  held  me  in  detesta- 
tion, and  kept  themselves  from  me.  Yet  am  I 
not  utterly  ruined,  though  my  light  is  diminished 
in  me.  I  have  cried  to  the  light  with  all  the 
light  that  was  in  me,  and  I  have  stretched  forth 
my  hands  unto  thee.
