JESUS' CONVERSATIONAL STYLE

WITH NICODEMUS (John 3:1-21)
Nicodemus: Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God.
Jesus: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus: How can a man be born when he is old?
Jesus: Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth:
so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

WITH THE WOMAN AT THE WELL (John 4:7-26)
Woman: How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
Jesus: If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink;
thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
Woman: Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.
Jesus: Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst.

WITH PETER (Matthew 16:13-20)
Jesus: Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Disciples: Some say John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias.
Jesus: But whom say ye that I am?
Peter: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Jesus: Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
but my Father which is in heaven.
