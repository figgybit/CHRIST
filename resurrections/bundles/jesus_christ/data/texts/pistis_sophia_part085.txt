the  Christians  were  still  lawfully  persecuted ;  but  on  the

other  band  the  author  does  not  seem  to  have  written  in  a

persecution  he  had  gone  through.     Thus  Harnack  eliminates

the  persecution  of  Maximin  and  arrives  at  the  302  limit.

But  all  this  is  very  unsatisfactory ;  and    deductions  made

from  internal   evidence,   though   an   essential   part    of   the

higher   criticism,    are   in    this    case   based    on    too    slender

premises.     The   method  of  Amelineau,   who  compares  the

known    fragments  of   Valentinus   with    the    text   of  Pistis

Sophia,  is  the  only  really  satisfactory  test.

In  the  first  case,  a  few  pages  later  on  (2.53)  the  first  short

extract    is    inserted    in     the    text,    and    in    the    second,

almost    immediately    after,    the    Pistis    Sophia    treatise    is

concluded  (page   357),    and   we  find  the  rest  of  the  MS.

devoted  to  a  far  longer  extract  from  the  Books  of  the  Saviour.

These  extracts  bear  a  remarkable  similarity  to  the  contents

of  the  Coptic  Papyrus,  which  the  famous  Scottish  traveller

Bruce  brought  to   England  in   1769   from   Upper   Egypt,

and  bequeathed  to  the  care  of  the  Bodleian  Library.     This

Papyrus  consists  of   78  leaves,    each   containing  from    27

to  34  lines,  29  centimetres  high  by   17   wide,   not  in  roll

but  in  book  form.     It   is  written   in  Greek  characters  and
