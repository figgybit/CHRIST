know  each    other  in   the  lord,   and    have  been 
saved  by  the  water  of  life  everlasting.'

"Hearken,  therefore,  my  Master,  that  I  may 
utter  the  word  in  freedom,  as  thy  power  pro- 
phesied, through  Solomon.  (132)  'A  flood  hath 
come  forth ;  it  hath  become  a  great  stream, 
strong  and  wide ' ;  this  is  the  light-stream 
which  spread  itself  in  chaos,  in  all  the  region  of 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant,

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  hath  again 
uttered  through  Solomon,  '  It  hath  carried  all 
away ;  it  poured  them  over  the  temple ' ;  that 
is  to  say,  it  carried  away  all  the  light-powers 
from  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  which  they 
had  taken  from  Pistis  Sophia,  and  it  poured 
them  again  into  Pistis  Sophia.

"  And  the  word  thy  power  again  hath  said, 
*  The  enclosures  and  structures  have  not  been 
able  to  hold  it  in ' ;  that  is  to  say,  the  emana- 
tions of  Arrogant  have  not  been  able  to  hold  the 
light-stream  within  the  walls  of  the  darkness  of 
chaos.

"  And  the  word  which  it  also  uttered,  '  It 
spread  over  the  whole  land,  and  filled  every- 
thing ' ;  that  is  to  say,  when  Gabriel  and 
Michael  led  it  over  the  body  of  Pistis  Sophia,  it 
poured  into  Sophia  all  the  light-powers  which 
the  emanations  of  Arrogant  had  taken  from  her, 
and  her  material  body  became  radiant.

132  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

"And  the  word  which  it  also  spake,  'They 
who  were  in  the  parched  land  have  drunk ' ; 
that  is  to  say,  all  that  were  in  Pistis  Sophia 
have  been  illuminated,  [the  powers]  from  which 
the  light  had  previously  been  taken  away.

"And  the  word  which  it  uttered,  'Their 
thirst  hath  departed  and  is  quenched';  that  is  to 
say,  (133)  her  powers  ceased  to  lack  their  light, 
for  they  had  had  restored  to  them  the  light 
which  had  been  taken  away.
