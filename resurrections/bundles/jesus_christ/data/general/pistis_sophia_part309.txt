height  as  a  great  light-stream,  and  the  receivers 
shall  not  be  able  to  take  hold  upon  it,  nor  will 
they  know  the  way  which  it  goeth,  for  it  hath 
become  a  radiant  stream,  and  flieth  into  the 
height,  and  no  power  shall  be  able  to  restrain 
it  at  all  in  any  way,  nor  be  able  to  come 
nigh  it.

of  the  rulers  and  all  the  regions  of  the  light-

any  region,  nor  any  apology,  nor  any  symbol, 
for  no  power  of  the  rulers,  no  power  of  the  light- 
emanations,  shall  be  able  to  come  nigh  that  soul. 
But  all  the  reigjions  of  the  rulers,  and  all  the 
regions  of  the  light-emanations,  each  of  them  in 
its  own  region,  shall  sing  a  song  unto  it,  in  fear 
of  the  light  of  the  stream  that  shall  clothe  that 
soul,  until  it  hath  passed  through  all  of  them,
