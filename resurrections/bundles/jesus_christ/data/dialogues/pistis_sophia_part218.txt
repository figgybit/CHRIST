which  is  the  herald  below  the  regions  "  'Sus. 
of  truth.  It  hath  been  said  again,  '  Righteousness 
and  peace  have  kissed  each  other.'  Righteous- 
ness, then,  is  the  spirit  of  light  which  came  upon 
thee,  which  hath  brought  the  mysteries  of  the 
height,  (123)  to  give  them  unto  the  human 
race.  Peace,  also,  is  the  power  of  Sabaoth  the 
good,  who  is  in  thee,  who  hath  baptised  and 
hath  pardoned  the  human  race ;  it  [the  power] 
hath  made  it  at  peace  with  the  children  of 
light.  And  again,  as  thy  power  hath  said, 
through  David,  '  Truth  hath  flourished  on 
the  earth,'  this  is  the  power  of  Sabaoth  the 
good.

"  He  hath  said,  '  Truth  hath  flourished  on  the 
eartb,'  [for]  it  hath  flourished  in  Mary,  thy 
mother,  who  dwelleth  on  earth.  Righteousness, 
also,  which  '  hath  looked  down  from  heaven,'  is 
the  spirit  which  is  in  the  height,  which  hath 
brought  all  the  mysteries  of  the  height,  and 
hath  given  them  to  the  human  race ;  men 
have  become  righteous,  they  have  become 
good,    they    have    inherited    the    kingdom     of

light."

And  it  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard 
the  discourse  which  Mary  uttered,  that  he  said  :  • 
"  Well  said,  Mary,  inheritor  of  light."

And  again  Mary,  the  mother  of  Jesus,  came 
forward,  she  bowed  herself  at  his  feet,
