a  ome.  ^^^  ^^^  Saying  which  thou  hast  uttered, 
to  wit,  that  it  is  written  in  the  Law  of  Moses, 
'  He  who  shall  leave  his  father  and  mother,  let 
him  die  the  death '  ;  now,  therefore,  sister 
Salome,  the  Law  hath  spoken  this  neither  con- 
cerning the  soul,  nor  concerning  the  body,  nor 
concerning  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit,  (343)  all 
of  which  are  the  children  of  the  rulers,  and  come 
forth  from  them  ;  but  the  Law  hath  spoken  it 
concerning  the  power  which  came  forth  from  the 
saviour,  and  which  is  the  indweller  of  light  in 
[each  of]  us  unto  this  day.  The  Law  hath 
further  said,  '  Whoever  shall  remain  without  the 
saviour  and  his  mysteries  which  are  all  his 
parents,  let  him  die  the  death,  nay  let  him  be 
lost  in  utter  destruction.'  "

threw  her  arms  round  Mary  and  kissed  her 
again.  Salome  said  :  "  May  the  saviour  make 
me  illumined  like  unto  thee  !  "

It  came  to  pass  when  the  saviour  had  heard 
the  words  of  Mary,  that  he  proclaimed  her 
blessed  again  and  again.  And  the  saviour  con- 
tinued again  in  his  conversation,  and  said  unto 
Mary  in  the  midst  of  his  disciples  :  "  Hearken, 
therefore,  0  Mary,  who  [it  is  that]  forceth  a 
man  to  sin.

"  Now,  therefore,  the  rulers  seal  the  counter- 
feit of  the  spirit  to  the  soul,  not  that   of  the
