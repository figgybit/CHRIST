immediately,  but  only  when  I  come  to  speak  of 
the  emanation  of  the  [whole]  pleroma ;  [then] 
will  I  tell  you  every  detail,  one  by  one,  for  it 
hath  emanated  together  with  its  own  word,  just 
as  it  is  in  itself,  together  with  the  sum  total 
of  all  its  limbs  which  belong  to  the  regulation 
of  the  one  and  only  one,  the  changeless  god  of 
truth — in  the  region,  therefore,  of  which  each 
shall  receive  the  mystery  in  the  space  of  that 
ineffable,  there  shall  he  inherit  up  to  the  region 
which  he  shall  have  received,  and  also  [as  far  as] 
the  whole  region  of  the  space  of  that  ineffable  ; 
nor  shall  he  give  explanation  throughout  the 
regions,  nor  apology,  nor  symbol,  for  [such  souls] 
are  without  symbol  and  have  no  receivers,  but 
they  shall  pass  through  all  the  regions  until 
they  arrive  at  the  region  of  the  kingdom  of  the 
mystery  which  they  have  received.
