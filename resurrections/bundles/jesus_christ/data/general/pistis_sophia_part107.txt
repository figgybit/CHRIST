But  the   disciples   saw  not  Jesus  because  of 
the   great   light    in    which  he  was,  or   ^  g^.. 
which   proceeded  from  him  ;  for  their   fSâ„¢en* 
eyes  were  blinded  by  the  great  light   ^^^^^y- 
in  which  he  was.       They    saw   the    light    only, 
shooting  forth   great    rays   of  light.      And  the 
rays  of  light  were  not  equal  together,  but  the 
light    was   of   every   kind,  and    of   every   type, 
from  the  lower  to  the  higher  part  thereof;  each 
[ray]    more    admirable   than    its   fellow,    in    in- 
finite manner,  in  a  great  glory  of  immeasurable 
light,    which    stretched  from  the    earth    to  the 
heavens.      And  when  the  disciples  saw  the  light, 
they  were  in  great  fear  and  great  confusion.

was    borne    upward    or    soared    aloft,    i^^^^'^'^- 
shining  exceedingly  in  an  immeasurable   light. 
And  the  disciples  gazed  after  him,  none  of  them 
speaking,  until  he  had  entered  into  the  heaven. 
They  were  all  in  great   silence.      These  things 
then  came  to  pass  on  the  fifteenth  day  of  the 
moon,  the  day  on  which  it  is  full  in  the  mouth 
of  Tobe.

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  ascended  into 
heaven,  after  the  third  hour,  that  all  the  powers 
of  the  heavens  were  confused,  and  all  were 
thrown  one   on  another  in   turn,   they  and  all
