" '  0  light,  Adamas,  the  worker  of  in- 
justice, is  enraged  against  me;  he  sophiayet 
hath  created  an  emanation  of  darkness,  If^^^^  ^h?' 
and  he  hath  also  sent  forth  another  i^ig^*- 
chaos ;  he  hath  created  another  region  of  dark- 
ness and  of  chaos,  and  hath  made  it  ready. 
Now,  therefore,  0  light,  in  the  [very]  chaos 
which  he  hath  created  in  order  to  cast  me  therein 
and  then  take  from  me  my  light,  take  from  him 
his  own  ;  and  for  the  plan  that  he  devised  to 
take  away  my  light,  his  own  shall  be  taken  from 
him  ;  and  for  the  injustice  of  which  he  spake,  to 
take  away  the  light-powers  which  are  in  me, 
all  of  his  shall  be  taken  from  him.'

"  These  are  the  words  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered  in  her  song.  Now,  therefore,  let  him 
who  is  sober  in  mind  come  forward,  and  ex- 
pound the  interpretation  of  Pistis  Sophia  in  her 
song."

And  Martha  came  forward  and  said  :  (175) 
"  I  am  sober  in  my  mind,  and  I  understand 
the  words  which  thou  hast  said.  Now,  there- 
fore, give  unto  me  commandment  to  expound 
their  interpretation  in  freedom."

The  first  mystery  answered,  and  said  unto 
Martha :  "  I  give  unto  thee  commandment,  0 
Martha,  to  expound  the  interpretation  of  the 
words  which  Pistis  Sophia  uttered  in  her  song."

And  Martha  answered  and  said  :  "  My  Master,

these  are  the  words  which  thy  light-power  pro-

Psalm,  saying  :
