Nor  had  Jesus  told  his  disciples  of  what  type 
are  the  five  supporters,  or  from  what  The  light- 
region  they  were  brought  forth ;  nor  '^Â°'^^'^- 
had  he  told  them  how  the  great  light  had 
emanated,  or  from  what  region  it  had  been 
brought  forth ;  nor  had  he  told  them  of  the  five 
impressions,  nor  of  the  first  statute,  from  what
