When,  therefore,  the  saviour  had  said  these 
words,  he  tried  Peter  to  see  whether  he  were 
compassionate  and  would  grant  remission.  And 
when  the  saviour  had  spoken  these  words,  Peter 
answered  and  said  :  "  Master,  pardon  her  yet 
once  again  this  time,  so  that  we  may  give  unto 
her  the  higher  mysteries  ;  and,  if  she  prove  her- 
self fit  [for  receiving  them],  thou  wilt  have  her  in- 
herit the  kingdom  of  light,  but  if  she  prove  unfit, 
thou  wilt  cut  her  off  from  the  kingdom  of  light."

When,  therefore,  Peter  had  thus  spoken,  the 
saviour  knew  that  Peter  was  compassionate  like 
unto  himself  and  would  give  pardon.  And  when 
all  this  was  done,  the  saviour  said  unto  his  dis- 
ciples :  "  Have  ye  understood  all  these  words 
and  also  the  type  of  this  woman  ?  "

spoken  concerning  this  woman.  Of  former  say- 
the  things,  therefore,  which  have  been  ^^^' 
done  unto  her  thou  didst  speak  unto  us  afore- 
time in  parable,  saying,  '  A  certain  man  had  a 
fig-tree  in  his  garden,  and  came  to  find  if 
there  were  any  fruit  thereon,  and  found 
none.  He  said  to  the  gardener,  "  Lo  three 
years  that  I  come  to  find  fruit  on  this  fig- 
tree,  and  I  find  none  thereon ;  therefore  cut 
it  down,  for  it  wasteth  the  soih"  But  he 
answered  and  said  unto  him,  "  Master,  let  it 
remain  one  more  year,  until  I  dig  about  it,  and 
manure  it ;  and  if  it  bear  fruit  next  year,  thou 
shalt  let  it  remain,  but  if  thou  [still]  find  none 
thereon,  thou  shalt  cut  it  down." '  This,  0 
Master,  is  the  interpretation  of  the  saying."
