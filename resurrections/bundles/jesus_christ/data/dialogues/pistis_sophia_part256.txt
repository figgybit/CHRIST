He  continued  again  in  his  conversation,  and 
said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  These  are  all  the  things 
which  befell  Pistis  Sophia.  (lf&gt;6)  It  came  to 
pass,  therefore,  when  I  had  brought  her  to  the 
region  which  is  below  the  thirteenth  a3on,  that 
I  was  about  to  enter  into  the  light  and  cease 
to  busy  myself  concerning  her.  She  said  unto 
me  :

"  '  0  light  of  lights,  thou  art  about  to  go 
The  con-  ^^  ^^®  light  and  to  cease  to  busy  thyself 
Sophia'and  conccming  me,  and  tyrant  Adamas 
the  hght.  ^j]]^  know  that  thou  hast  ceased  to 
busy  thyself  on  my  behalf ;  he  will  know  that  he 
who  should  preserve  me,  is  no  longer  [here], 
and  he  will  come  again  to  this  region,  he  and 
all  his  rulers  who  hate  me,  and  Arrogant  will  again 
give  power  unto  his  lion-faced  emanation  ;  they 
will  all  come  and  will  constrain  me  together  to 
take  away  all  the  light  which  is  in  me,  that  I 
may  become  powerless  and  again  without  light. 
Now,  therefore,  0  light  of  my  light,  take  from 
them  their  light,  that  they  may  no  longer  from 
this  hour  be  able  to  constrain  me.'

"  It  came  to  pass,  when  I  had  heard  these 
words  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake  unto  me,  that 
I  answered  her,  and  said  :  '  My  father,  who  caused

commandment  to  take  their  liojht  from

them ;    but  1  will  seal  the  regions  of  promiseth 
Arrogant  and  of  all  his  rulers  who  hate   regions  of 
thee.     And  I  will  also  seal  the  regions 
of  Adamas  and  of  his  rulers,  so  that   none   of 
them    may  be   able   to    fight  against  thee  until 
their  time  is  fulfilled,  and  until  even  the  time 
hath  come  when  my  father  shall  give  me  com- 
mandment to  take  away  their  light.'
