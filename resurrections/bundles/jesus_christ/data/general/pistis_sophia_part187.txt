and  a  house  of  refuge  to  save  me,  for  thou  art 
my  support  and  my  refuge.  For  thy  Matthew 
name's  sake  thou  shalt  guide  me,  and  etrXT^re- 
thou  shalt  feed  me,  and  thou  shalt  draw  from^Psaim 
me  out  of  this  snare,  which  they  ^^â–  
have  laid  privily  for  me ;  for  thou  art  my 
strength.  I  will  place  my  spirit  in  thy  hands  ; 
thou  hast  preserved  me,  0  lord,  God  of  truth. 
(87)  Thou  hatest  them  that  hold  to  vanity  with- 
out a  cause.  But  as  for  me,  I  have  trusted,  and 
I  shall  rejoice  in  my  saviour.  I  shall  be  glad  in 
thy  spirit,  for  thou  hast  regarded  my  humble- 
ness, and  thou  hast  saved  my  soul  from  my  con- 
straints. Thou  hast  not  closed  my  mouth,  in 
the  hands  of  the  wicked,  thou  hast  planted  my 
feet  steadily  in  a  spacious  region.  Have  mercy 
upon  me,  0  lord,  for  I  am  in  tribulation.  My 
eye  is  confused  because  of  their  anger,  and  also 
my  heart ;  for  my  years  have  been  spent  in 
sadness  of  heart,  and  my  life  is  spent  in  groan- 
ing. My  strength  is  enfeebled  in  poverty,  and 
my  bones  are  troubled.  I  am  become  an  object 
of  derision  for  all  my  enemies  and  them  that 
draw  nigh  unto  me.  (88)1  am  become  an  object 
of  fear  for  them  who  knew  me,  and  they  who  have 
seen  me,  have  fled  far  from  me.  They  have 
forgotten  me  in  their  heart  as  a  corpse,  and  I 
have  been  as  a  vessel  that  is  lost.  For  I  have 
heard  the  cursing'  of  the  hosts  that  surrounded
