"  Remit  the  sins  of  these  souls,  blot  out  their 
offences,  both  those  which  they  have  committed 
knowingly,  and  those  they  have  committed  un- 
knowingly, and  those  which  they  have  committed 
in  fornication  and  adultery  even  unto  this  day, 
remit  them  unto  them,  and  make  them  fit  to 
be  counted  in  the  kingdom  of  my  father,  and 
worthv  to  receive  of  this  offerino;.

"  Holy  father,  my  father,  if  then  thou  hast 
heard  me,  (377)  if  thou  hast  remitted  the  sins 
of  these  souls,  and  blotted  out  their  offences, 
and  made  them  fit  to  be  reckoned  in  thy  king- 
dom, give  unto  me  the  sign  in  this  offering."

And  the  sign  of  which  Jesus  spake,  was 
given.

Jesus  said  unto  his  disciples  :    "  Rejoice  and 
be   fflad,   for  your    sins    are  remitted,    '^^^  ^^"^^  ^^ 
your  offences  blotted  out,  and  ye  have   mated.

And  when  he  had  thus  spoken,  the  disciples 
rejoiced  with  great  joy.

hearken  unto  you  in  every  good  tbing,  their
