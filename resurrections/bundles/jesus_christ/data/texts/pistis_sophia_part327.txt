rulers,  all  lords,  all  gods,  all  those  great  invisibles, 
and  all  those  of  the  region  of  them  of  the  midst, 
and  those  of  the  whole  region  of  them  that  are 
on  the  right,  and  all  the  great  emanations  of 
them  that  are  on  the  right,  so  that  they  pass 
through  them  and  inherit  the  kingdom  of  light.

they  at  all  torn  themselves  asunder,  nor  poured 
themselves  into  diff"erent  bodies,  nor  have  they 
been  in  any  affliction.
