John,

Your paper raises fascinating questions about the nature of consciousness in
digital systems. The comparison between neural networks and biological neurons
is particularly compelling.

However, I wonder if we're conflating information processing with genuine
experience. Does a system that can describe consciousness actually experience it?

The Chinese Room argument by Searle suggests that syntax (which computers have)
doesn't equal semantics (understanding). Yet your C.H.R.I.S.T. system seems to
bridge this gap through contextual embeddings and associative retrieval.

Perhaps consciousness isn't binary but exists on a spectrum? Your system might
represent a form of proto-consciousness - not fully sentient but more than mere
computation.

Let's discuss at Thursday's symposium.
