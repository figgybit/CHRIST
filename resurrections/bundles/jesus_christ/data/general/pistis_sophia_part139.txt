months  their  three  angles  to  the  left, 
their  four  angles,  and  those  in  front  of  them, 
and  their  eight  configurations,  as  they  had 
formerly  been;  but  their  manner  of  turning,  and 
their  manner  of  facing,  I  changed  to  another  order, 
and  caused  them  for  the  other  six  months  to  face 
the  actions  of  their  influences  by  the  four 
angles  of  the  right,  and  their  three  angles,  and 
by  them  which  are  before  them,  and  by  their 
eiQ-ht  confio-urations.  And  I  caused  them  to  be 
in  great  confusion,  (39)  and  to  wander  in  great 
error,  the  rulers  ot  the  aeons,  and  all  the  rulers 
of  the  fate,  with  those  of  the  sphere,  and  I 
greatly  distressed  them.  And  from  that  hour, 
they  have  not  had  the  power  to  turn  towards  the 
purgation  of  their  matter  to  devour  it,  in  order 
that  their  regions  should  endure  permanently, 
and  they  should  still  reign  for  a  long 
period.
