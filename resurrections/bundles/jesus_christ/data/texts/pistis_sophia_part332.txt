from  which  there  is  no  treasure,  apart  from 
which  there  is  no  individuality  in  the  world  ; 
but  there  are  other  words  [besides  the  word  of 
this  world],  other  mysteries,  other  regions.

midst.  He  is  a  saviour  and  free  of  every 
space,  who  hath  found  the  words  of  the 
mysteries,  the  words  of  the  third  space  towards 
the  interior.  He  is  the  very  pleroma  itself — 
the  object  of  desire  of  all  who  are  in  that  third 
space — who  hath  found  the  mystery  (254)  in 
which  they  [all]  are  and  in  which  they  are  [all] 
set.  Wherefore  is  he  equal  to  [all  of  them]. 
He  hath  found  also  the  words  of  the  mysteries, 
which  I  have  written  down  for  you  by  a  simili- 
tude, namely  the  members  of  the  ineffable. 
Amen,  I  say  unto  you,  he  who  hath  found  the 
words  of  these  mysteries  in  the  truth  of  God, 
that  man  is  chief  in  the  truth,  he  is  its  peer, 
because  of  these  words  and  mysteries.  The 
pleroma  verily  oweth  its  being  to  that  mystery. 
For  which  cause,  he  who  hath  found  the  words 
of  these  mysteries,  is  equal  to  the  chief  [of  all]. 
It  is  the  gnosis  of  the  gnosis  of  the  ineffable, 
concerning  which  I  speak  unto  you  this  day."
