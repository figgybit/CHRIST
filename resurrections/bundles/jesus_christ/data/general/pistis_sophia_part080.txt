Thus  we  see  that  Woide  places  the  date  of  the  MS.  at 
latest  about  the  latter  end  of  the  fourth  century.  It  is  also 
quite  evident  that  the  whole  MS.  from  first  to  last  is  by  the 
same  hand,  and  that  it  is  a  copy  of  another  MS.  There 
are  also  a  few  corrections  at  the  top  or  bottom  of  the 
columns  by  a  hand  of  the  same  date.  An  inspection  of  its 
contents  reveals  the  further  indisputable  fact  that  the  Coptic 
text  was  not  only  a  translation  from  a  Greek  original^  but 
that  it  has  preserved  an  enormous  quantity  of  the  original 
Greek  terms  without  any  attempt  at  translation.  This 
may  at  once  be  seen  from  Schwartze's  Latin  version,  in 
which  he  has  also  preserved  these  innumerable  Greek 
words  without  translation.

The  whole  style   of  the   work,   moreover,   is  foreign  to
