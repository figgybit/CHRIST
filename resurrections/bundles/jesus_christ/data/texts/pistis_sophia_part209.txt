thee  have  I  sung  a  song.  Thou  hast  sent  me 
thy  light  from  thyself,  and  thou  hast  saved  me. 
Thou  hast  brought  me  to  the  higher  regions  of 
chaos.  Let  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  which 
pursue  me,  therefore,  fall  below  into  the  lower 
regions  of  chaos,  and  let  them  not  come  into  the 
higher  regions  of  chaos   to  see  me.     Let  great

darkness  cover  them,  and  let  the  mighty  gloom 
of  darkness  come  upon  them,  and  let  them  not 
see  me  in  the  light  of  thy  power,  which  thou  hast 
sent  unto  me  to  save  me,  that  they  may  no 
longer  have  any  power  over  me.  And  let  the 
counsel  which  they  have  imagined  against  me, 
to  take  away  my  power,  no  longer  be  accom-

about  me  to  take  away  my  light,  take  from  them 
theirs  in  place  of  mine.  They  have  designed  to 
take  away  my  light,  and  have  not  been  able  to 
take  it ;  for  thy  light-power  is  with  me,  and  they 
have  taken  counsel  together  without  thy  com-

not  been  able  to  take  away  my  light,  because 
I  have  trusted  in  the  light.  (114)  I  shall  not 
be  afraid  ;  the  light  is  my  saviour,  and  I  will

"  Now,  therefore,  let  him  whose  power  is 
exalted,  utter  the  interpretation  of  the  words 
which  Pistis  Sophia  spake."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  those  words  unto  his  disciples,  that 
Salome  came  forward,  and  said  :  "  Master,  my 
power  constraineth  me  to  utter  the  interpreta- 
tion of  the  words  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake. 
Thy  power  hath  prophesied  of  old  through 
Solomon,  saying  :

"'I  will   confess   myself  unto   thee,  0    lord,
