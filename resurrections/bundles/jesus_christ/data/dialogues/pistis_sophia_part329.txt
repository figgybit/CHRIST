race  hath  need  of  purification,  for  all  men  are 
purgations  of  matter.  For  this  cause  I  said 
unto  you  aforetime,  '  They  that  are  whole,  need 
no  physician,  but  they  that  are  sick ' ;  (250) 
that  is  to  say,  they  that  are  of  the  light  have 
no  need  of  the  mysteries,  for  they  are  pure 
light-powers,  but  the  human  race  hath  need  of 
them,  for  [men]  are  purgations  of  matter.

"  For  this  cause,  therefore,  preach  ye  to  the 
whole  human  race,  saying,  '  Cease  not  to  seek 
day  and  night,  until  ye  have  found  the  purify- 
ing mysteries ' ;  and  say  unto  them,  'Renounce 
the  whole  world,  and  all  the  matter  therein,'  for 
he  who  buyeth  and  selleth  in  this  world,  he  who 
eateth  and  drinketh  of  his  own  matter,  who  liveth 
in  his  own  cares  and  in  all  his  own  associations, 
amasses  ever  fresh  matter  from  his  matter,  in 
that  the  whole  world,  and  all  that  is  therein, 
and  all  its  associations,  are  exceedingly  material 
purgations,  and  they  shall  make  enquiry  of 
every  one  concerning  his  purity.

"  For  which  reason,  then,  I  said  to  you  afore- 
time, '  Renounce  the  whole  world  and  all  the 
matter  therein,'  that  ye  may  not  add  other 
matter  to  the  matter  which  is  already  in  you. 
Therefore,  preach  ye  this  to  the  whole  human 
race,  saying,  '  Renounce  the  whole  world  and  all 
its  associations,  (251)  that  ye  may  not  add  fresh 
matter  to  the  matter  which  is  already  in  you ' ;

250  PISTIS   SOPHIA.

and  say  unto  them,  '  Cease  not  to  seek  day  and 
night,  and  stay  not  your  hands  until  ye  have 
found  the  purifying  mysteries  which  shall 
cleanse  you,  and  will  transform  you  into  pure 
light,  that  ye  may  enter  into  the  height  and 
inherit  the  light  of  my  kingdom.'
