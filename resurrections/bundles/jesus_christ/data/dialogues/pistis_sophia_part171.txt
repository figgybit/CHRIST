every  word  which  I  shall  speak,  and  everything 
which  I  shall  do,  and  everything  which  ye  shall 
see.  But  as  for  thee,  the  tale  of  the  words 
which  thou  hast  to  write,  is  not  completed. 
But  when  it  shall  be  completed,  thou  shalt  come 
forward,  thou  shalt  utter  that  which  thou  shalt 
desire.  Now,  therefore,  it  is  ye  three  who  shall 
write  every  word  which  I  shall  speak,  and 
everything  which  I  shall  do  and  see,  and  I  will 
bear  witness  to  you  of  all  things  which  are  in  the 
kingdom  of  the  heavens."  And  when  Jesus  had 
spoken  these  words,  he  said  unto  his  disciples  : 
"  He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear."

thou  hast  uttered.  Now,  therefore,  my  Master, 
hearken  that  I  may  speak  in  freedom.  Thou 
hast  said  unto  us,  'He  that  hath  ears  to  hear, 
let  him  hear.'  Concerning  the  discourse  which 
thou  hast  uttered  unto  PhiHp,  '  It  is  to  thee, 
and  Thomas,  and  Matthew,  to  whom  it  hath  been 
entrusted — to  you  three  by  the  first  mystery, 
to  write  down  every  word  of  the  kingdom  of 
light,  in  order  that  ye  may  bear  witness  thereof  ; 
hearken,  therefore,  while  I  expound  the  inter- 
pretation of  this  word,  which  thy  light-power 
prophesied  of  old  through  Moses,  saying,  '  By 
two  or  three  witnesses  everything  shall  abound.' 
The  three  witnesses  are  Philip,  Thomas,  and 
Matthew."
