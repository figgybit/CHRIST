of  Sophia,  into  thy  dwelling-place.  Turn  not 
thy  image  of  light  from  me,  but  regard  me.  If 
they  constrain  me,  haste  thee,  and  save  me, 
when  I  shall  cry  unto  thee,  for  my  time  passeth 
away  as  vapour,  and  I  am  become  as  matter. 
They  have  taken  away  my  light,  and  my  power 
is  dried  up.  I  have  forgotten  my  mystery 
which  I  performed  in  the  beginning ;  because  of 
the  din  of  the  fear  and  power  of  Arrogant,  my 
power  hath  failed  in  me.  I  am  become  as  a 
mere  daemon  dwelling  in  matter ;  I  am  become 
like  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit,  which  is  in  a

material  body,  in  which  there  is  no  light-power  ;  I 
am  become  like  as  a  mere  decau  of  the  air. 
The  emanations  of  Arrogant  have  constrained 
me  mightily,  and  my  consort  hath  said  to  him- 
self, "  Instead  of  the  light  which  was  in  her,  they 
have  filled  her  with  chaos."  I  have  myself  de- 
voured the  sweat  of  my  matter,  and  the  anguish 
of  the  tears  of  the  matter  of  my  eyes,  that  they 
who  were  constraining  me  might  not  take  what 
remains,  (64)  All  these  things  have  been  done 
unto  me,  0  light,  by  thy  order  and  command- 
ment, and  it  is  thy  commandment  that  I  am 
therein.  Thy  commandment  hath  brought  me 
below,  and  I  am  descended  like  a  power  of 
chaos,  my  power  hath  grown  cold  in  me.
