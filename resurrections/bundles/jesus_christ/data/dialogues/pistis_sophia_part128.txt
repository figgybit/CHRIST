"Thus  then  the  power  which  was  in  Isaiah, 
the  prophet,  prophesied  before  thy  coming ;  it 
prophesied  concerning  thee  that  thou  shouldst 
take  away  the  power  of  the  rulers  of  the  aeons  ; 
that  thou  shouldst  change  their  sphere  and 
their  fate,  in  order  that  they  might  know  no- 
thing from  henceforth.  This  is  why  it  said, 
'  Ye  shall  know  nothing  of  that  which  the  lord 
Sabaoth  shall  do ' ;  that  is  to  say,  none  of  the 
rulers  shall  know  what  thou  wilt  do  unto  them 
henceforth  from  this  hour ;  that  is  to  say,  with 
'  Egypt,'  for  they  are  the  inefficacious  matter. 
The  power,  therefore,  which  was  in  the  prophet 
Isaiah,  prophesied  concerning  thee  aforetime, 
saying,  '  Henceforth,  from  this  hour,  ye  shall 
not  know  what  the  lord  Sabaoth  shall  do  unto 
them,'  because  of  the  light-power  which  thou 
didst  receive  from  the  hand  of  Sabaoth,  the 
good,  who  is  in  the  region  of  the  right,  the 
power  which  is  in  thy  material  body  to-day.  For 
this  cause,  therefore,  0  Jesus,  my  master,  thou

hast  said  unto  us,  'He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let 
him  hear,'  since  thou  wouldst  know  whose  heart 
is  earnestly  set  on  the  kingdom  of  the  heavens."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Mary  had  finished 
saying  these  things,  that  Jesus  said  unto  her : 
"  Well  said,  Mary,  since  thou  art  blessed  before 
all  women  who  are  on  the  earth,  (29)  for  thou 
shalt  be  the  pleroma  of  all  pleromas,  and  the 
perfection  of  all  perfections."

When  Mary  heard  the  saviour  speak  these 
Jesus  com-  words,  shc  rejoiccd  greatly,  and  came
