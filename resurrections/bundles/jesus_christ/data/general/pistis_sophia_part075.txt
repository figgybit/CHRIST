The  Gnostic  doctors  could  not  believe  that  the  Jews  were 
the  only  nation  in  the  past  to  whom  God  had  revealed 
himself,  and  that  the  scriptures  of  the  nations  were  to  be 
cast  on  the  dustheap  of  falsehood  and  error.  And  yet  they 
saw  that  the  old  order  of  things  had  received  a  rude  shock, 
and  that  the  fierce  faith  which  had  been  aroused  among  the 
people  in  the  personality  of  Jesus,  and  the  social  revolution 
which  was  rushing  along  with  leaps  and  bounds  under  their 
very  eyes,  could  never  be  dammed  back  again.  All  they 
could  hope  to  do  was  to  turn  the  energy  generated  into  a 
more  universal  channel.  Accordingly  they  used  the  tradi- 
tional story  of  Jesus  w'hich  had  roused  such  mighty  enthu- 
siasm, as  the  fi'amework  into  which  they  wove  the  "wisdom" 
of  the  great  religions.  Believing,  as  they  did,  that  truth 
was  one,  and  at  no  time  a  respecter  of  persons  or  nations ; 
that  all  the  nations  had  received  of  that  truth  in  proportion 
to  their  needs  and  capacities,  they  wove  these  ideas  into 
the  Christian  tradition,  and  compiled  gospels  and  apocalypses 
of  that  veiled  and  mysterious  wisdom  which  had  been 
guarded  so  carefully  in  the  temples  throughout  the  ages, 
and  into  which  they  believed  Jesus  had  been  initiated  and 
was  in  his  turn  an  initiator.  Nor  did  they  so  much  invent 
these  things  out  of  their  ov,m  beads  as  it  would  appear,  but 
rather  compiled  them  from  existing  scriptures,  many  of 
which  have  since  disappeared.  They  drew  from  the  wisdom 
of  Egypt,  Chaldfca,  Babylonia,  Assyria,  Phoenicia,  Jjlthiopia, 
the  books  of  Orpheus,  Pythagoras  and  Plato,  of  the  Magi 
and  Zoroaster  ;  and  even  perhaps  in  some  indirect  way  from 
those  of  the  Brahmans.  Their  source  of  information  was  for 
the  most  part  the  Orient.
