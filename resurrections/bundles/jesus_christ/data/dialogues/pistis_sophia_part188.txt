me,  when  they  all  massed  themselves  together 
against  me ;  they  laid  plots  to  take  away  my 
soul.  But  as  for  me,  I  have  trusted  in  thee,  0 
lord,  I  have  said,  "Thou  art  my  God,  my  lot 
is  in  thy  hands."  Save  me  from  the  hand  of 
mine  enemies,  and  deliver  me  from  them  that 
persecute  me.  Show  thy  face  unto  thy  servant, 
and  save  me  in  thy  mercy,  0  lord.  Let  me 
not  be  ashamed,  for  I  have  cried  unto  thee. 
Let  the  unrighteous  be  ashamed,  and  let  them 
descend  into  hell.  Let  the  crafty  lips  be  put 
to  silence,  which  speak  iniquity  against  the 
righteous  with  pride  and  cursing.'"

And  when  Jesus  had  heard  these  words,  he 
Jesus  com-   Said  :    "  Well    said,    Matthew.       (89)

when  he  had  spoken  these  things,  he  said : 
"  Understand  ye  what  I  say  ? "

And  Mary  came  forward  again,  and  said : 
"  Master,  on  this  matter  thou  hast  spoken  to
