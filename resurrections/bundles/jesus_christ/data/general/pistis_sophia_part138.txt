"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  as  the  rulers  of 
the  aeons,  and  those  of  the  fate,  with  those  of 
the  sphere,  persevered  in  so  doing,  in  turning 
on  themselves,  in  devouring  the  purgation  of

into  the  world  of  men,  in  order  that  they  might 
be  kings  for  a  longer  period,  and  that  the  powers, 
which  are  the  powers  in  them,  might  be  for  a 
long  time  excluded  from  this  world — they  con- 
tinued to  do  this  persistently  for  two  cycles — it 
came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  I  set  forth  to  ac-

called  by  commandment  of  the  first  mystery, 
that  I  passed  through  the  midst  of  the  tyrants

tyrant,    and    all    the    tyrants    of    the   nght^ves-  ^ 
twelve     aeons,     all     began     to     battle 
against     the     light    of    my    vesture,     desiring

to  keep  it  with  them,  in  order  to  remain 
the  longer  in  their  kingdom.  And  this  they 
did,  not  knowing  then  against  whom  they 
fought.

"  Then,    when    they    had    rebelled,    fighting

against  the  light,  then,  by  command-
