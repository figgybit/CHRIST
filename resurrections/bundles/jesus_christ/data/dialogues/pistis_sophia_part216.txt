vine  poles.  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when 
thou  didst  hear  me  saying  this  thing  unto 
Joseph,  that  thou  didst  understand,  and  thou 
wert  joyful,  and  saidest,  '  Where  is  he,  that  I 
may  see  him  ?  Nay  [rather],  I  am  expecting 
him  in  this  place.'  And  it  came  to  pass,  when 
Joseph  heard  thee  say  these  words,  that  he  was 
disturl)ed.  (121)  We  went  together,  we  entered 
into  the  house,  we  found  the  spirit  bound  to  the 
bed,  and  we  gazed  upon  thee  and  him,  and 
found  that  thou  wert  like  unto  him.  And  he 
that  was  bound  to  the  bed,  was  unloosed,  he 
embraced  thee  and  kissed  thee,  and  thou  also 
didst  kiss  him ;  ye  became  one  and  the  same 
being.

"  This,  then,  is  the  word  and  its  interpretation. 
Mercy  is  the  spirit  which  came  from  the  height, 
[sent]  by  the  first  mystery,  to  take  pity  on  the 
human  race  ;  he  sent  his  spirit  to  pardon  the 
sins  of  the  whole  world,  that  they  might  receive 
the  mystery,  that  they  might  inherit  the  king- 
dom of  light.  Truth,  also,  is  the  power  which 
dwelt  in  thee,  issued  from  Barbelo.  It  became 
thy  material  body,  and  the  herald  below   Of  thespir-

mysteries  from   on  high,  to   give   them   to  the 
race  of  men.     Peace,  also,  is  the  power  which 
dwelt  in  thy  material  body,  according  to  the  world.
