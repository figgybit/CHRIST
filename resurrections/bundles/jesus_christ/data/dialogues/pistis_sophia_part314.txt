"  Wherefore  have  I  said  unto  you  aforetime, 
'  He  that  believeth  on  a  prophet,  shall  receive  a 
prophet's  reward,  and  he  that  believeth  on  a  just 
man,  shall  receive  a  just  man's  reward.'  He  shall 
enter  into  the  region  of  which  he  shall  receive 
the  mystery.  He  who  receiveth  a  lower  mystery, 
shall  inherit  a  lower  region  ;  and  he  who  re- 
ceiveth a  higher  mystery,  shall  inherit  the  region 
of  the  height.  And  each  shall  dwell  in  his  region 
in  the  light  of  my  kingdom,  each  shall  have 
power  over  the  lower  orders,  but  he  will  not 
have  power  to  enter  into  the  higher  orders  ;  he 
shall  dwell  in  the  region  of  the  inheritance  of 
the  light  of  my  kingdom,  (234)  in  stupendous 
light  which  cannot  be  measured  either  by  gods 
or  all  the  invisibles ;  he  shall  be  in  great  joy 
and  great  gladness.

"Now,  therefore,  also,  hearken,  I  will  speak 
with  you  concerning   the    glory    of   those   also
