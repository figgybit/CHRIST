Whether  or  not  the  Extracts  from  the  Books  of  the 
Saviour  appended  to  the  MS.  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  belong 
to  the  missing  portions  of  the  Codex  Brucianus,  or 
whether  the  translator  from  the  Greek  abridged  some 
portion  of  the  Books  of  leou  to  give  his  readers  an  idea  of 
these  books  to  w^hich  the  text  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  had 
just  made  reference,  it  is  impossible  to  say  ;  this  much  is 
certain,  that  the  Books  of  the  Saviour  and  the  treatises  of

INTRODUCTION.  XXXlll

the  Codex  Brucianiis  are  united  by  the  closest  ties  of  con- 
sanguinity, and  that  a  commentator  on  the  one  must  be 
intimately  acquainted  with  the  contents  of  the  other.

The  frequent  mention  of  the  name  Melchisedec  through- 
out the  text  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  reminds  us  of  the  frag- 
ment of  Melchisedecian  literature  translated  by  Charles 
(v.  s.),  and  its  close  connection  with  the  Enochian  literature, 
and  points  perhaps  to  one  of  the  sources  of  the  Greek 
original  of  the  Books  of  the  Saviour,  and  also  of  Pistis 
Sophia.

The  disconnected  column  at  the  end  of  Book  I.  un- 
doubtedly belongs  to  the  same  collection  of  writings 
as  the  Books  of  the  Saviour,  and  also  the  two  pages  (253, 
254)  inserted  in  the  middle  of  Book  II.  Finally  the  odd 
column  at  the  end  of  the  MS.  may  either  come  from  the 
same  source  or  be  an  unaided  effort  of  the  translator  or 
scribe.

Let    us  now    run   over    the    probable    history    of    our 
treatise,  and  suggest  the  accidents  which  may  have  The  pro-
