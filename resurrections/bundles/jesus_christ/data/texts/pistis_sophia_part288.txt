It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had 
finished  speaking  these  words  unto  his  disciples, 
that  Mary  Magdalene  came  forward,  and  said 
unto  Jesus  :  "  Master,  be  not  wroth  with  me  if 
I  question  thee,  for  I  importune  thee  mauy  a 
time  and  oft.  Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  be  not- 
wroth  with  me  if  I  question  thee  on  every 
matter  with  earnestness  and  confidence  ;  for  my 
brethren  will  preach  it  unto  the  race  of  human 
kind,  that  they  may  hear  and  repent,  (200)  and 
be  saved  from  the  harsh  judgments  of  the  evil 
rulers,  that  they  may  enter  into  the  height  and 
inherit  the  kingdom  of  light ;  for,  0  my  Master,

not  only  are  we  compassionate  among  ourselves, 
but  we  are  also  merciful  minded  to  the  whole 
race  of  human  kind,  that  they  may  be  saved 
from  these  harsh  judgments.     Now,   therefore,

0  Master,  this  is  why  we  question  on  every 
matter  with  earnestness  and  confidence,  that  my 
brethren  may  tell  it  forth  to  the  whole  human 
race,  that  they  may  not  fall  into  the  hands  of 
the  malignant  rulers  of  the  outer  darkness."

It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard  the 
word  which  Mary  spake,  that  the  saviour 
answered  with  great  compassion  for  her,  and 
said  unto  her :  "  Ask  what  thou  wilt,  and  I 
will  reveal  it  unto  thee  with  earnestness  and 
certainty,  and  without  parable."
