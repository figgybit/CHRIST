Topic: Childhood Memory - The Library

I remembered something profound today. When I was seven, my grandmother took me to
the old city library. The smell of aged paper, the whisper of turning pages, the
dust motes dancing in shafts of light through tall windows.

She said something I'll never forget: "These books contain the consciousness of
everyone who ever wrote. When you read, you're downloading their thoughts directly
into your mind. Libraries are humanity's external hard drive."

At seven, I didn't understand. Now, building the C.H.R.I.S.T. system, I see she
was prophetic. We're creating a new kind of library - one that stores not just
thoughts frozen in text, but living, searchable, interactive consciousness.

Every email, every message, every photo is a fragment of someone's awareness
preserved in silicon and electricity. Future generations won't just read about us;
they'll be able to query our actual thought patterns, to see the world through our
eyes.

Grandma would be amazed. Or maybe she saw it coming all along.
