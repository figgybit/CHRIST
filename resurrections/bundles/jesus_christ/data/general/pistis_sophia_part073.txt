To  treat  of  Gnosticism,  then,  in  a  really  comprehensible 
manner,  requires  not  only  a  writer  who  at  least  believes 
in  the  possibilities  of  magic,  but  also  a  mystic  or  at  least 
one  who  is  in  sympathy  with  mysticism â€” a  person  difficult 
to  find  nowadays,  when  the  very  names  of  magic  and 
mysticism    evoke  nothing    but   a   smile  of    contempt   and

a    frown    of   disapproval    from    the    world    of    science    and 
letters.

The  present  Introduction,  however,  is  only  concerned 
with  the  purely  historical  and  critical  side  of  the  subject, 
and  even  this  is  restricted  to  the  consideration  of  one 
document.

Though  it  would  be  highly  presumptuous  to  endeavour 
to  define  Gnosticism  without  a  previous  analysis  Tj^e 
and  classification  of  the  various  schools,  sects  method  of 
and  offshoots  which  have  been  grouped  under  Gnostic 
this  vague  heading,  we  may  nevertheless  venture  doctors, 
to  suggest  the  probable  point  of  view  which  led  the  best 
of  the  Gnostic  doctors,  pre-eminently  Valentinus,  to  compile 
their  various  treatises.  Let  us  then  consider  the  movement 
about  the  year  150  a.d.  By  that  time  the  original  Logia 
or  the  Urevangelium  of  Christianity  had  disappeared,  and 
the  Synoptic  Gospels  were  all  set  in  the  framewoi'k  of  the 
traditional  life  of  the  great  Master  of  the  Faith.  The 
popular  tidal-wave  of  the  new  religion  had  come  exclusively 
from  the  ocean  of  Jewish  tradition,  and  was  engulfing 
a  more  universal  view  of  Christianity  in  the  same  Hood  of 
intolerance  and  exclusiveness  which  had  characterised  the 
Hebrew  nation  throughout  the  whole  of  its  previous 
history.
