Finally  we  may  mention  the  ^Ethiopic  Enochian  litera- 
ture. In  1773  Bruce  brought  back  from  Abyssinia  three 
copies  of  the  yEthiopic  version  of  The  Book  of  Enoch. 
Archbishop  Laurence  issued  a  translation  in  1821  (2nd  ed., 
1833  ;  3rd,  1838),  under  the  title  The  Book  of  Enoch. 
Hoflfman  published  a  German  translation,  Das  Buch  Henoch 
(Jena,  1838),  Gfrorer  a  Latin  version  of  no  value  (Stuggart, 
1840)  ;  Dillmann  a  critical  text  and  also  a  German  version 
(Leipzig,  1851;  2nd  ed.,  1853);  Migne's  Dictionuaire  des 
Apocryphes  (1856)  contains  an  anonymous  French  transla- 
tion ;  there  is  also  an  anonymous  reprint  of  Laurence's 
translation,  with  a  controversial  introduction  (London, 
1883);  and  finally  Charles  recently  (1893)  published  an 
English  translation  from  Dillmann's  text.  This  year  Charles 
has  also  published  The  Book  of  the  Secrets  of  Enoch  (Oxford), 
a  translation  from  Slavonic,  which  presents  us  with  a  new 
tradition  entirely,  namely,  the  Slavonic  Enoch,  from  a  Greek 
original  which  he  places  from  B.C.  30  to  a.d.  70,  the  Greek 
having  in  its  turn  a  Hebrew  background  of  a  still  earlier 
date.  In  an  Appendix  is  a  translation  from  the  Slavonic  of 
a  fragment  of  Melchisedecian  literature.  For  more  than 
1200  years  this  version  of  Enoch  has  been  unknown  save  in 
Russia,  and  in  Western  Europe  was  not  known  to  exist 
even  in  Russia  till  1892.

Outside  of  apocryphal  scriptures  and  the  world-bibles, 
these  are  all  the  documents  connected  directly  or  indirectly 
with  the  Gnosis,  which,  to  my  knowledge,  we  possess ;  and, 
in  spite  of  the  good  work  that  has  been  done  since  1850,
