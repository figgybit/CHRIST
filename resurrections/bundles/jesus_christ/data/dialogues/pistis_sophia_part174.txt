therefore,  go  and  take   thy  seat,  and 
write  thy  portion  of  all  the  words  which  I  shall 
speak,  and  of  all  things  which  I  shall  do,  and  of 
all    that    thou    shalt    see."      And    immediately 
Philip  sat  down  and  wrote.

It  came  to  pass  again,  after  that,  that  Jesus

continued  to  speak.  He  said  unto  his  disciples  : 
"Then  did  Pistis  Sophia  cry  to  the  light,  in 
order  that  her  sin  might  be  forgiven  her,  in 
leaving  her  region  and  going  into  the  darkness. 
She  recited  her  sixth  repentance,  saying :

(74)    " '  I   sing   a   song  unto   thee,   0   light,

light  give  heed  to  the  voice  oi  my 
prayer.  0  light,  if  thou  bearest  in  mind  my 
sin,  I  shall  not  be  able  to  come  nigh  thee,  and 
thou  wilt  abandon  me  ;  for  thou,  0  light,  thou 
art  my  saviour,  because  of  the  light  of  thy  name. 
I  have  trusted  in  thee,  0  light,  and  my  power 
hath  trusted  in  thy  mystery,  and  also  my  power 
hath  trusted  in  the  light  which  is  in  the  height ; 
it  hath  trusted  also  in  the  chaos  below.  Let  all 
the  powers  which  are  in  me,  trust  in  the  light, 
while  I  am  in  the  lower  darkness  ;  may  they  also 
trust  in  the  light,  if  they  go  into  the  region  of 
the  height,  for  it  is  [the  light]  which  shall  see 
and  save  us,  and  there  is  a  great  mystery  of 
salvation  in  it.  It  is  the  light  that  shall  save 
all  the  powers  of  chaos  because  of  my  trans- 
gression, for  I  have  left  my  region.  I  am  come 
into  chaos.'
