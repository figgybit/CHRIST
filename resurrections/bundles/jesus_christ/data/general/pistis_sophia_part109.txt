him,  for  he  shone  more  brightly  than .  when  he 
had  ascended  to  the  heavens,  so  that  it  is 
impossible  for  any  in  this  world  to  describe  the 
light  in  which  he  was.  He  shot  forth  rays 
shining  exceedingly ;  his  rays  were  without 
measure,  nor  were  his  rays  of  light  equal  to- 
gether, but  they  were  of  every  figure  and  of 
every  type,  some  being  more  admirable  than 
the  others  in  infinite  manner.  And  they  were 
all  pure  light  in  every  part  at  the  The  nature 
same  time.  It  was  of  three  degrees,  °f^isgi°^- 
one  surpassing  the  other  in  infinite  manner.  The 
second,  which  was  in  the  midst,  excelled  the 
first  which  was  below  it,  and  the  third,  the  most 
admirable  of  all,  surpassed  the  two  below  it. 
The  first  glory  was  placed  below  all,  like  to  the 
light  which  came  upon  Jesus  (8)  before  he  as- 
cended into  the  heavens,  and  was  very  regular 
as  to  its  own  light.  And  the  three  degrees  of 
light  were  of  every  variety  of  light  and  type, 
each  excelling  the  others  in  infinite  manner.

It  came  to  pass,  when  the  disciples  had  seen 
these  things,  that  they  feared  exceed-   Jesus  ad-

the   compassionate   and  merciful-minded,   when 
he   saw   that  his  disciples  were    troubled    with 
great     confusion,     spake     unto    them,     saying : 
"Take  courage.     It  is  I,   be  not  afraid."

It  came  to  pass,    w^hen    the    disciples    heard

these  words,  that  they  said  :  "  Master,  if  it  be 
thou,  withdraw  thy  glorious  light  that  we  may 
be  able  to  stand,  so  that  our  eyes  be  not  blinded. 
We  have  been  dismayed,  and  the  whole  world 
hath  been  dismayed,  by  the  greatness  of  the  light 
which  is  in  thee."
