And  Jesus  continued  his  conversation,  and 
said:  "It  came  to  pass,  after  these  ofMsovm 
things,  that  I  looked  down  again  into  through''''' 
the  world  of  men  ;  I  found  Mary,  who  '^'^^^y- 
is  called  my  mother,  after  the  material  body  ;  I 
spoke  to  her  also  in  the  form  of  Gabriel ;  and 
when  she  had  betaken  herself  into  the  height 
towards  me,  I  implanted  in  her  the  first  power 
which  I  had  received  from  the  hands  of  Barbelo, 
that  is  to  say,  the  body  which  I  bore  in  the 
height,  and  instead  of  the  soul,  I  implanted 
in  her  the  power  which  I  had  received  from 
the  hands  of  the  great  Sabaoth,  the  good,  (14) 
who  is  in  the  region  of  the  right.

"And  the  twelve  powers  of  the  twelve  saviours 
of  the  treasure  of  light,  which  I  had   ^jo^g  ^^^^^ 
received  from  the  twelve  ministers  of  ifj^^"^^*^Â® 
the  midst,   I   cast  into  the   sphere  of  fj^J^jJci" 
the    rulers ;    and    the    decans    of    the   p^^^- 
rulers,  with  their  workmen,  thought  that  they 
were  the  souls  of  the  rulers  ;  and  the  workmen 
brought  them,  and  I  bound  them  into  the  bodies 
of  your  mothers.     And  when  your  time  was  full, 
ye  were  brought  forth   into  the   world,  no  soul 
of  the  rulers  being  in   you.     Ye  have  received
