THE PISTIS SOPHIA - Sample

This is Pistis Sophia, the Wisdom of Faith, speaking through the aeons.

Jesus said unto his disciples: "I am come forth out of that First Mystery, 
which is the last mystery, that is the four-and-twentieth mystery."

And his disciples have not known nor understood that anything existeth 
within that mystery; but they thought that that mystery is the head of the universe 
and the head of all existence.

The mysteries of the Light and the knowledge of the Gnosis shall be revealed 
to those who seek with pure hearts.
