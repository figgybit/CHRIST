"  And  when  the  soul  hath  endured  the  punish- 
ments in  chaos  according  to  the  sins  which  it 
hath  committed,  (285)  the  counterfeit  of  the 
spirit  leadeth  it  forth  from  chaos,  and  haunteth 
it,  confronting  it  in  ever}''  region  with  the  sins 
which  it  hath  committed,  and  it  bringeth  it  forth 
into  the  way  of  the  rulers  of  the  midst.  And 
when  it  hath  come  unto  them,  [the  rulers]  con- 
front it  with  the  mysteries  of  the  destiny,  and  if 
it  have  not  discovered  them,  then  they  examine 
their  destiny.  And  [then]  these  rulers  punish 
that  soul  according  to  the  sins  of  which  it  is 
guilty.  I  will  tell  you  the  type  of  their  punish- 
ments in  explaining  the  emanation  of  the 
pleroma.

according  to  the  commandment  of  the  first  man

say,  the  virgin  of  light.  And  she  proveth  that 
soul ;  she  findeth  that  it  is  a  sinning  soul,  and 
casteth  into  it  her  light-power,  to  unite  it  with  a 
body  and  common  sensory.  And  I  will  tell  you 
the  type  of  all  this  in  explaining  the  emanation 
of  the  pleroma.  And  the  virgin  of  light  sealeth 
that  soul,  and  handeth  it  over  to  one  of  her 
receivers,  and  will  have  it  carried  into  a  body, 
(286)  which  is  the  record  of  the  sins  which  it 
hath  committed.
