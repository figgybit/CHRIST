Amelineau  makes  rather  too  much  of  the  abstruse  nature 
of  the  subject ;  for,  though  many  passages  are  transcendent- 
ally  mystical,  nevertheless  the  whole  is  conceived  in  a 
narrative  or  descriptive  style.  There  is  no  attempt  at 
philosophical  argument,  no   involved  logical    propositions  ;

INTRODUCTION.  XXIX

there  may  also  be  another  reason,  as  we  shall  suggest  later

on,  for  the    "  losing  of  the  thread."     Nevertheless  the  main

argument  of  this  learned  Coptic  scholar  is  unanswerable.

And  not  only  is   it  evident  that  we  are  dealing  with  a

translation  into  Coptic  from  Greek,  but  also  that  ^

-,     ,.  .  General

we    are  not  dealing  Avith  a   single   work,    but  at  analysis

least  with  two  treatises,  fragments  of  one  of  which  ^^  ^^^'

tents. 
have  been  in  two  places  inserted   in   the  body  of

the  main  treatise,  and  a  larger  fragment  appended  at  the

end  of   the    MS.     The    main   narrative  also   is    broken  by

several  important  lacunre,  due   in  one  case  to  the  loss  of

several  leaves  of  the  MS.,  and  generally  to  the  carelessness

of  the  scribe  ;  the  MS.  is,  moreover,  evidently  incomplete.

A  general  analysis  of  the  contents  reveals  the  following

general  outline  of  contents,   the  refei'ences    being  to  the

pagination  of  the  MS.  adopted  in  Schwartze's  text,  which

is  retained  between  brackets  in  the  present  translation.

Pistis  Sophia,  Book  1 1-124

Pistis  Sophia,  Book  11.  ...     126-357

From  the  Books  of  the  Saviour     .         .     357-390

There  is,  however,  no  title  to  Book  I.,  nor  does  there 
seem  to  be  any  reason  why  the  title  "  The  Second  Book  of 
Pistis  Sophia  "  should  be  inserted  where  it  is,  right  in  the 
middle  of  the  narrative.
