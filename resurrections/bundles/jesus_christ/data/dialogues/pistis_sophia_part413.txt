"  For  this  cause  have  I  said  unto  you  afore- 
time, '  He  who  shall  not  leave  father  and  mother 
to  follow  after  me  is  not  worthy  of  me.'  What 
I  said  then  was,  '  Ye  shall  leave  your  parents  the 
rulers,  that  ye  may  be  all  children  of  the  first 
everlasting  mystery.' "

(342)  And  when  the  saviour  had  said  these
