It  came  to  pass,  when  the  first  mystery 
had  heard  these  words  which  Matthew  had 
uttered,  that  he  said  :  "  Well  said,  Matthew ;  it 
is  well,  0  well-beloved.  This  is  the  interpreta- 
tion of  the  song  which  Pistis  Sophia  spake."

And  the  first  mystery  continued  in  his  con- 
Sophiacon-   versation,  and  said  :    "  '  I  will  declare

that  hast  preserved  me,  and  hast  brought 
me  unto  thee ;  who  hast  prevented  the  emana- 
tions of  Arrogant,  which  were  my  enemies,  from 
taking  my  light,  0  light  of  light.  I  have  sung 
a  song  unto  thee ;  thou  hast  preserved  me,  0 
light ;  thou  hast  brought  my  power  out  of  chaos  ; 
thou  hast  preserved  me  from  them  that  descend 
into  the  darkness.'

"  These  words  Pistis  Sophia  uttered.  Now, 
therefore,  let  him  who  hath  a  comprehending 
mind,  and  who  hath  understood  the  words 
uttered  by  Pistis  Sophia,  come  forward  and 
expound  their  interpretation."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the  first 
Mary  is        mystery  had   finished   speaking  these

came  forward,  and  said:  (161)  "Master,  my 
mind  is  ever  comprehending,  so  that  I  could 
come    forward    every    time    and    expound   the

but  I  fear  Peter,  for  he  hath  threatened  me,  and 
hateth  our  sex."

And  when  she  had  spoken  these  words,  the 
first  mystery  said  unto  her :  "  No  one  shall 
prevent  whosoever  shall  be  filled  with  the 
spirit  of  light  from  coming  forward  and  expound- 
ing the  interpretation  of  what  I  say.  Now, 
therefore,  0  Mary,  expound  the  interpretation  of 
the  words  uttered  by  Pistis  Sophia."
