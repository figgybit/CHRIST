me,  for  I  acted  according  to  thy  will,  when  I 
was  in  my  seon.  I  did  according  to  thy  will, 
like  those  invisibles  who  are  in  my  region,  and 
as  my  consort.  And  I  was  in  grief,  looking, 
searching  for  the  light.  Now,  therefore,  all  the 
emanations  of  Arrogant  have  surrounded  me, 
they  have  rejoiced  over  me,  and  have  mightily 
constrained  me  in  my  ignorance.  They  fled 
away,  they  left  me,  but  they  had  no  pity  upon 
me  ;  they  returned,  they  tried  me,  they  con- 
strained me  in  great  affliction ;  they  gnashed 
their  teeth  against  me,  seeking  to  take  away  my

me  from  the  hands  of  this  lion-faced  power ;  for 
I  alone  of  the  invisibles  am  in  this  region.  (92)

am  in  the  midst  of  all  them  that  are  massed

in  the  midst  of  them  that  constrain  me. 
Now,  therefore,  0  light,  let  not  them  that  hate 
me,  and  desire  to  take  away  my  power,  rejoice 
over  me â€” them  that  hate  me  and  flash  their 
eyes  against  me,  though  I  have  done  nothing 
unto  them  ;  for  they  have  spoken  flattering 
words  unto  me,  asking  for  the  mysteries  of  the 
light  which  I  knew  not ;  speaking  unto  me  with 
guile,  and  being  enraged  against  me,  because  I
