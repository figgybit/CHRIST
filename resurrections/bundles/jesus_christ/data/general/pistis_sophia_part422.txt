may  save  the  sinners  who  shall  believe  on  me, 
and  shall  give  ear  unto  me,  that  I  may  loose 
them  from  the  bonds  and  seals  of  the  aeons  of  the 
rulers,  and  bind  them  to  the  seals  and  vestures 
and  orders  of  the  lig;ht ;  so  that  everv  one  that 
I  should  set  free  in  the  world  from  the  bonds 
and  seals  of  the  seons  of  the  rulers  should  also 
be  loosed  in  the  height  from  the  bonds  and 
seals  of  the  aeons  of  the  rulers,  and  every  one 
that  I  should  bind  in  the  world  to  the  seals 
and  vestures  and  orders  of  the  light,  should 
be  bound  in  the  light-land  to  the  orders  of  the 
inheritances  of  the  light.

"  It  is  for  the  sake  of  sinners,  therefore,  that  I 
have  torn  myself  open,  at  this  time,  and  have 
brought  unto  them  the  mysteries,  that  I  might 
free  them  from  the  aeons  of  the  rulers,  and  bind 
them  unto  the  inheritances  of  light ;  and  not  only 
for  the  sake  of  sinners,  but  also  of  the  just,  to 
give  them  the  mysteries  and  bring  them  unto 
the  light,  for  without  the  mysteries  they  cannot 
be  brought  thither.

(352)  "  For  this  cause,  therefore,  I  have 
hidden    nothing,    but    I    have     cried   Themys-

sinners,  but  I  have  cried  aloud,  and  have  spoken 
to  every  man,  unto  sinners  and  unto  the 
righteous,  I  have  said,  '  Seek  that  ye  may  find, 
knock  that  it  may  be  opened  unto  you  ;  for  every

one  that  seeketh  in  truth,  shall  find,  and  to  him 
that  knocketh,  it  shall  be  opened.'  For  I  have 
spoken  unto  all  men,  that  they  may  seek  out 
the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of  the  light,  which 
shall  cleanse  them  and  make  them  pure,  that 
they  may  be  brought  unto  the  light.
