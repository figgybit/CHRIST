of  whom  all  they  who  dwell  in  the  86ons  have 
said,  "  She  hath  become  chaos."  And  then  all 
the  pitiless  powers  surrounded  me  together, 
and  plotted  to  take  away  all  the  light  which  was 
in  me.  But  as  for  me,  I  have  trusted  in  thee, 
0  light,  and  I  have  said,  "  Thou  art  my  saviour, 
and  the  commandment  which  thou  hast  decreed 
for  me  is  in  thy  hands."  Save  me  from  the 
hands  of  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  who  con- 
strain me,  and  persecute  me.  Send  thy  light 
upon  me,  for  I  am  as  nothing  before  thee,  (86) 
and  save  me  by  thy  mercies.  Let  me  not  be 
ashamed ;  for  it  is  to  thee  that  I  sing  my  song, 
0  light.  Let  chaos  cover  the  emanations  of 
Arrogant,  let  them  be  led  down  into  the  dark- 
ness. Let  the  mouth  of  them  that  wish  to 
devour  me  with  guile,  who  say,  "  Let  us  take 
all  the  light  that  is  in  her,"  although  I  have 
done  them  no  ill,  [let  their  mouth]  be  stopped."*

And  when  Jesus  had  spoken  these  things, 
Matthew  came  forward,  and  said  :  '*  Master,  thy 
spirit  hath  roused  me,  and  thy  light  moveth  me 
to  reveal  this  eighth  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia, 
for  thy  power  hath  prophesied  thereof  of  old 
through  David,  in  the  thirtieth  Psalm,  saying  :

"  '  On  thee,  0  Lord,  have  I  set  my  heart,  let 
me  never  be  ashamed ;  save  me  in  thy  righteous- 
ness. Incline  thine  ear  unto  me,  haste  thee, 
save   me.      Be    thou    unto    me    a    strong    God,
