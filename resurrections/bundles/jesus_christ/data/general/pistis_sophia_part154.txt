whelmed  me,  I  am  a-wearied  with  crying,  my 
throat  is  hoarse.  My  eyes  failed  me,  when  I 
set  my  heart  on  God.  They  that  hate  me  with- 
out a  cause  are  more  than  the  hairs  of  my  head. 
My  foes  have  prevailed  against  me,  they  who 
pursued  after  me  with  violence.  They  asked 
me  for  that  which  I  never  took  from  them. 
God,  thou  knowest  my  simpleness,  and  my 
faults  are  not  hid  from  thee.  Let  not  them  that 
wait  on  thee,  0  lord,  be  ashamed  for  my  sake. 
0  lord  of  powers,  let  not  those  who  seek  thee 
be  confounded  through  me,  0  lord,  God  of 
Israel,  0  lord  of  powers ;  for  it  is  for  thy  sake 
that  I  have  suffered  reproach,  that  shame  hath 
covered  my  face,  that  I  am  become  a  stranger 
unto  my  brethren,  even  an  alien  unto  my 
mother's  children ;  for  the  heat  of  thy  mansion 
hath  devoured  me,  and  the  reproaches  of  them  that 
reproached  thee  have  fallen  upon  me.  I  bowed 
my  soul  with  fasting,  and  that  was  turned  to 
my  reproach.  I  put  on  sackcloth ;  I  became  a 
bye-word  among  them.  They  who  sat  at  the 
gates  mocked  at  me,  and  the  drunkards  made  a 
song  about  me.

"  '  But  as  for  me,  I  prayed  in  my  soul  to  thee, 
0  lord.  (54)  The  time  is  thine,  0  God.  In 
the  greatness  of  thy  mercy,  give  ear  unto  my 
salvation,  in  truth.  Take  me  out  of  this  mire, 
that  I  sink  not ;  let  me  be  delivered  from  them
