with  words  of  hate.  They  have  fought  against 
me  without  a  cause ;  instead  of  loving  me  they 
have  accused  me.  But  as  for  me,  I  continued 
in  prayer.  They  have  raised  up  evil  against 
me  in  return  for  good,  and  hate  for  love.  Set 
thou  an  ungodly  one  over  him,  and  may  the 
accuser  stand  at  his  right  hand.  When  sentence 
is  given  upon  him,  let  him  be  condemned,  and 
let  his  prayer  be  regarded  as  sin  ;  may  his  days 
be  shortened,  and  may  another  receive  his  over- 
seership ;  may  his  children  be  fatherless,  and  his 
wife  a  widow.  May  the  head  of  his  children  be

fatherless  children.  Let  his  children  be  blotted

generation.  Let  the  sin  of  his  fathers  be  remem- 
bered before  the  lord,  and  let  not  the  sin  of 
his  mother  be  blotted  out.  Let  them  be  ever 
before  the  lord.  Let  his  memory  be  destroyed 
on  the  earth,  in  that  he  hath  not  thought  of 
mercy  ;  for  he  hath  persecuted  the  poor  and 
helpless,  he  hath  persecuted  a  wretched  creature 
to  put  him  to  death.  He  hath  loved  cursing ; 
let  him   fall   into  the  midst  thereof.     He  hath
