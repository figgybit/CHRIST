It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  finished 
speaking  these  things  to  his  disciples,  that  he 
again  continued  in  his  conversation,  and  said 
unto  them  :  "  Lo,  I  have  put  on  my  vesture, 
and  all  power  hath  been  given  me  by  the  first 
mystery.  Yet  a  little  while  and  I  will  tell  you 
the  mystery  of  the  pleroma  and  the  pleroma  of 
the  pleroma  ;  I  will  conceal  nothing  from  you 
from  this  hour,  but  in  perfectness  will  I  perfect 
you  in  the  whole  pleroma,  and  all  perfection, 
and  every  mystery,  (16)  which  things,  indeed, 
are  the  perfection  of  all  perfections,  the  pleroma 
of  all  pleromas,  and  the  gnosis  of  all  gnoses, 
which  are  in  my  vesture.  I  will  tell  you  all 
mysteries  from  the  exterior  of  the  exteriors,  to 
the  interior  of  the  interiors.  Hearken,  1  will 
tell  you  all  things  which  have  befallen  me.

"It  came  to  pass,  when  the  sun  had  risen  in 
the  regions  of  the  east,   that  a  great

was  my  vesture,  the  same  which  I  had   on  the 
laid    up    in    the   four   and    twentieth 
mystery,   as    I    have   said   unto    you.       And    I 
found    a    mystery    in    my   vesture,    written    in 
these  five  words  which  pertain  to    the   height,

the  interpretation  thereof:

"  The  mystery  which  is  beyond  the  world, 
The  inter-  that  whereby  all  things  exist  :  It  is 
thereof.  all  evolution  and  all  involution  ;  it 
projected  all  emanations  and  all  things  therein. 
Because  of  it  all  mysteries  exist  and  all  their 
regions.
