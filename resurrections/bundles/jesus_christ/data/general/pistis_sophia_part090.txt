The  MS.  of  the  Coptic  translator  was  copied  towards  the 
end  of  the  foui'th  century  by  some  ignorant  copyist,  who 
made  many  mistakes  of  orthography.  It  was  copied  by 
one  man,  as  a  task,  and  hun'iedly  executed  ;  and  I  should 
suggest  that  two  copies  were  then  made  and  occasionally 
a  page  of  one  copy  substituted  for  a  page  of  the  other ;  and, 
as  the  pages  were  not  quite  exact  to  a  word  or  phrase,

we  thus  may  account  for  some  puzzling  repetitions  and  for 
equally  puzzling  lacunfe.

What  was  the  histoi-y  of  the  MS.  after  that  date  is 
almost  impossible  even  to  conjecture.  Its  history  must, 
however,  have  been  exciting  enough  for  it  to  have  escaped 
the  hands  of  fanatics  both  Christian  and  Mohammedan.  It 
was  during  this  period  also  that  some  of  the  pages,  as  we 
have  seen,  w^ere  lost.  May  we  not  also  hope  that  Abyssinia 
and  Upper  Egypt  may  still  preserve  some  MSS.  that  may 
throw  further  light  on  this  obscure  but  most  interesting 
subject?  In  fact,  I  was  told  in  1891  by  Achinoff,  chief  of 
the  Free  Cossacks,  a  resident  in  the  country,  that  the 
monasteries  of  Abyssinia  do  actually  contain  a  mass  of  very 
ancient  MSS.  which  would  be  of  exceeding  great  value  to  the 
scholarship  of  Europe.
