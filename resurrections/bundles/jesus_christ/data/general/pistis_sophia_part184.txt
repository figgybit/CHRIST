heed  unto  me  and  save  me.  Be  unto  me  a 
saviour,  0  light,  and  preserve  me ;  lead  me 
unto  thy  light,  for  thou  art  my  saviour,  and 
thou  shalt  lead  me  unto  thee.  Because  of  the 
mystery  of  thy  name,  lead  me  ;  give  unto  me 
thy  mystery.  Thou  shalt  save  me  from  this 
lion-faced  power,  with  which  they  have  lain  in 
wait  for  me,  for  thou  art  my  saviour  ;  and  I  will 
give  the  glory  of  my  light  into  thy  hands. 
Thou  shalt  have  set  me  free,  0  light,  by  thy 
gnosis.  Thou  art  wroth  with  them  that  watch 
over  me,  who  could  not  possess  themselves  of 
me  entirely.  But  as  for  me,  I  have  trusted  in 
the  light,  I  will  rejoice  ;  I  will  sing  a  song,  for 
thou  hast  been  compassionate  unto  me,  and  thou 
hast  considered  the  affliction  in  which  I  am, 
and  shalt  save  me.  Moreover,  thou  shalt  deliver 
my  power  from  chaos,  and  thou  hast  not  left 
me  in  the  hands  of  the  lion-faced  power,  but 
thou  hast  led  me  into  a  region  where  I  am  not 
constrained.' "

been  taken  entirely  out  of  chaos,  (85)  that  it 
came  again  with  all  the  other  material  emanations 
of  Arrogant.  They  constrained  Pistis  Sophia 
anew.  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  they 
had  constrained  her,  that  she  cried  out  in  the 
same  repentance,  saying  :
