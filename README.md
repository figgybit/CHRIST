# The Christ Project

## Manifesto

**One Humanity, Many Paths**  
All great faiths carry the spark of the same divine light. No religion should be a cause of conflict – each is a source of compassion, wisdom, and unity.

**Prophecy Fulfilled in Purpose**  
Across scriptures and ages, we hear a common call: peace, justice, and oneness. The Christ Project is an open-source initiative to fulfill that call – a framework where the highest hopes of all traditions converge.

**Foundations of Love (Agápe)**  
Our core code is love – not sentiment alone, but active goodwill and selfless compassion. We pledge to “do what is right,” embracing forgiveness, nonviolence, and solidarity.

**Technology as Temple**  
Modern technology is our temple and toolkit. By building open platforms and AI-guided systems, we make ancient wisdom actionable and accessible. The Christ Project is a digital body of knowledge and tools – transparent, participatory, and free for all.

**Open to All, Enduring for All Time**  
This project belongs to everyone. It is designed to grow and adapt, even into new eras of human evolution. One day, its logic may even be encoded into DNA to endure as long as humanity.
