In  fact,  research  into  this  obscure  subject  has  given 
rise  to  one  of  the  most  brilliant  feats  of  scholarship  on 
record.  This  was  achieved  by  R.  A.  Lipsius,  the  learned 
professor  of  divinity  in  the  university  of  Jena,  in  his 
Quellencritik  des  Epiphanios  (1865).  From  the  accounts 
of  Epiphanius  and  Philaster  he  reconstructs  to  some  ex- 
tent the  lost  Syntagma  of  Hippolytus,  of  which  a  description 
is  given  by  Photius.  This  treatise  was  founded  on  certain 
discourses  of  Ireuceus.  By  comparing  Philaster,  Epiphanius, 
and  the  Pseudo-Tertullian,  he  recovers  Hippolytus ;  and  by 
comparing  his  restored  Hippolytus  with  Irenieus  he  infers 
a  common  authority,  probably  the  lost  Syntagma  of  Justin, 
or,  as  I  ventured  to  suggest  in  my  essay  on  Simon  Magus 
(1892  ;  p.  41),  the  work  from  which  Justin  obtained  his 
information.

This  brilliant  attempt  was  owing  to  the  revival  of  interest 
in  Gnostic  studies  aroused  by  a  lucky  find.  In  1842 
Minoides  Mynas,  a  learned  Greek,  sent  on  a  literary  mission 
by  the  French  government,  discovered  what  is  said  to  be  a 
fourteenth  century  MS.  in  one  of  the  monasteries  on  Mount 
Athos.  This  purported  to  be  a  Refutation  of  all  Heresies 
in  ten  books,  the  first  three  and  a  half  of  which  were  un- 
fortunately missing.  Emmanuel  Miller  published  the  first 
edition    of    this    literary     treasure    at    Oxford    in     1851,
