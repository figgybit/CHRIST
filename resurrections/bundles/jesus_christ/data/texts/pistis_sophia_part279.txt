the  seven  voices  and  of  the  five  trees,  shall  be 
with  me  in  the  region  of  the  inheritance  of  light ;

each  being  kinor  over  his  emanations,  and  each 
being  king  according  to  his  glory,  the  great 
according  to  his  greatness,  and  the  little  accord- 
ing to  his  littleness.

first  voice  shall  be  in  the  region  of  the  souls 
which  shall  have  received  the  first  mystery  of 
the  first  mystery  in  my  kingdom.

second  voice  shall  be  in  the  region  of  the  souls 
which  shall  have  received  the  second  mystery 
of  the  first  mystery.
