The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you,  every  one  who 
shall  receive  the  mysteries  of  that  ineffable,  not

repent,  shall  his  sin  be  remitted,  but  also  if  he 
transgress  any  number  of  times,  and  then,  while 
still  in  life,  turn  again  and  repent,  and  should 
he  not  be  a  hypocrite,  but  turn  again  and  repent

be  forgiven  him  every  time,  in  that  he  hath

Jesus  :  "  Well,  then,  0  Master,  as  to  those  that 
receive  the  mysteries  of  that  ineffable,  and  again 
turn  back  and  commit  sin,  and  fall  away  in  their 
faith,  and  who  also  pass  from  the  body  without 
repentance,  what  will  happen  to  men  of  that 
kind  ?  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you,  all  men  who  shall
