i.  1851.  Schwartze  (M.  G.).  Pistis  Sophia,  Opus  Gnosticum 
Valentino  adjudicatum,  e  Codice  Manuscripto 
Coptico  Londiuensi  descriptum,  Latine  vertit 
M.  G.  Schwartze,  edidit  J.   H.   Petermann  (Bero-

lini).

Schwartze  died  at  an  early  age  before  the  completion  of 
his  labours  on  the  Pistis  Sophia,  and  the  MS.  translation 
he  left  behind  contained  a  number  of  blanks  and  passages 
which  he  intended  to  fill  up  and  correct.  Petermann  has 
confined  himself  in  his  notes  strictly  to  verbal  corrections 
and  suggestions  as  to  variaj  lectiones.  The  consequence 
is  that  we  have  a  translation  without  the  notes  of  the  trans- 
lator, and  without  a  word  of  introduction.  Petermann 
says  the  task  of  editing  was  so  severe  that  he  frequently 
suffered  from  fits  of  giddiness.  Schwartze  copied  out  the 
whole  of  the  Coptic  MS.  of  Pistis  Sophia  and  also  the 
Oxford  Codex  Brucianus.     He  considers  the  original  treatise,
