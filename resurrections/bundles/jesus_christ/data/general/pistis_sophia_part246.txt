path  to  lead  me  out  of  chaos.  Thou  hast  carried 
me  far  from  this  material  darkness,  and  thou  hast 
taken  from  it  all  my  powers,  from  which  the  light 
had  been  taken.  Thou  hast  infused  into  them 
a  pure  light,  (155)  and  unto  my  limbs,  which 
had  no  light,  thou  hast  given  a  pure  light  from 
the  light  of  the  height.  Thou  hast  made 
straight  the  way  before  them,  and  the  light  of 
thy  countenance  hath  become  for  me  a  life  that 
can  never  be  destroyed.  Thou  hast  brought  me

finished  speaking  those  words,  that  Matthew 
came  forward,  and  said  :  "  I  have  understood 
the  interpretation  of  the  song  which  Pistis 
Sophia  uttered.  Now,  therefore,  give  com- 
mandment unto  me,  to  expound  it  in  freedom."

The  first  mystery  answered,  and  said :  "I 
give  thee  commandment,  0  Matthew,  to  ex- 
pound the  interpretation  of  the  song  which 
Pistis  Sophia  uttered."

And  Matthew  answered,  and  said :  "  Con- 
cerning the  interpretation  of  the  song  which 
Pistis  Sophia  spake,  thy  light-power  pro- 
phesied of  old  concerning  it,  through  Solomon, 
saying :
