Of  Gnostic  works  that  have  come  down  to  us,  undoubtedly 
the  most  valuable  is  the  Coptic  codex,  of  which  we  are 
treating  in  the  present  work.  In  fact,  the  only  other  im- 
portant relic  of  the  Gnosis  w^hich  is  so  far  known  to  have 
withstood  the  ravages  of  time  and  escaped  the  destruction 
of  Christian  and  Mohammedan  vandalism,  is  the  Coptic 
papyrus,  known  as  the  Codex  Brucianus  and  preserved  in  the 
Bodleian  at  Oxford,  to  which  reference  will  be  made  later  on. 
In  the  same  library  there  is  also  another  Coptic  MS.,  a 
small  quarto  of  236  pages,  entitled  Treatise  on  the  Mysteries 
of  the  Greek  Letters,  to  which  an  Arabic  translation  is 
appended.  The  author  was  a  priest  called  Atasius,  who, 
somewhat  in  the  fashion  of  the  Gnostic  doctor  Marcus,

dogmas  of  creation,  providence  and  redemption,  as  Dulaurier 
tells  lis  (op.  inf.  cit,  p.  538).  Dulaurier  in  1847  promised  to 
publish  the  text  and  a  French  translation  of  this  work,  but 
his  labours  have  never  seen  the  light.
