"  And  so  forthwith  the  three  develop  sensa- 
tion, each  according  to  its  nature.  And  the 
receivers  of  wrath  also  give  order  unto  their 
workmen  to  follow  them,  and  be  witness  to  all 
the  sins  that  they  commit,  with  a  view  to  the 
manner  in  which  they  shall  punish  them  in  the 
judgments.

"  Thereupon  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  de- 
viseth  and    senseth  after   all  the  sins   ofthe 
and  evils  (283)  which  the  rulers  of  the   ^X*''^'^' 
fate   have    decreed   against  that  soul,    ^p^"*' 
and  it  bringeth  them  into  operation  against  that 
soul.

"  And  so  the  power  within  impelleth  the  soul 
to  seek  after  the  region  of  light  and  the  whole 
godhead ;  whereas  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit 
draggeth  down  the  soul  and  persistently  con- 
straineth  it  to  commit  every  kind  of  iniquity 
and  mischief  and  sin,  and  persisteth  as  some- 
thing foreign  to  the  soul,  and  is  its  enemy,  and 
maketh  it  commit  all  these  sins  and  evils.

"  It    spurreth    on    the    workmen    of    wrath,

moreover,  to  bear  witness  to  all  the  sins  which 
it  will  constrain  the  soul  to  commit.  And  even 
when  [the  soul]  sleepeth  by  night  or  by  day,  it 
plagueth  it  in  dreams  with  the  desires  of  the 
world,  and  causeth  it  to  long  after  all  the  things 
of  this  world.  In  a  word,  it  bindeth  it  to  all 
the  actions  which  the  rulers  have  decreed  for  it, 
and  is  the  enemy  of  the  soul,  causing  it  to  do 
what  it  would  not.

"  Now,  therefore,  Mary,  this  thing  is  the 
enemy  of  the  soul  ;  this  is  the  one  that  con- 
straineth  it  to  commit  all  kinds  of  sin.
