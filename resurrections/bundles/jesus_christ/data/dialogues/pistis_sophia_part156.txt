of  thy  countenance  hath  received  me  unto  itself. 
I  will  bless  the  name  of  God  in  a  son^,  and  I 
will  magnify  it  with  a  benediction.  This  shall 
please  the  lord  better  than  a  calf  new-born  that 
putteth  forth  its  horns,  or  than  a  young  kid.  Let 
the  poor  see  and  be  glad.  Seek  ye  God,  that 
your  souls  may  live ;  for  the  lord  hath  heard  the 
poor,  and  despiseth  not  them  who  are  in  the 
bands  of  brass.  Let  heaven  and  earth  bless  the 
lord,  the  sea  and  all  that  is  therein.  For  God 
will  save  and  preserve  in  Sion,  and  they  will 
build  the  cities  of  Judaea,  that  they  may  dwell 
in  them,  and  find  in  them  their  inheritance. 
The  seed  of  his  servants  shall  possess  it,  and 
they  who  love  his  name  shall  dwell  therein.' "

these  words  unto  Jesus,  in  the  midst  of  the 
disciples,  that  she  said  unto  him  :  "  Master,  this 
is  the  interpretation  of  the  mystery  of  the  re- 
pentance of  Pistis  Sophia."

(56)  It  came  to  pass,  when  Jesus  had  heard 
Mary  speak  these  w^ords,  that  he  said  unto 
her  :  "  AVell  said,  Mary,  thou  blessed  one,  the 
perfection  of  women,  the  most  blessed  of  perfec- 
tions, thou  whom  they  shall  beatify  in  every 
generation."

And  Jesus  continued  in  his  conversation,  and 
said  :    "  Pistis    Sophia    then   sang   her   The  second
