The  regent  said  :  "  The  second  order  [of  the  five 
second  da?-  daemonial  rulers],  called  ^Ethiopic  Ari- 
hierarchy.  outh,  is  a  female  ruler,  entirely  black ; 
and  under  her  are  fourteen  [arch]d8emons, 
ruling  over  other  hosts  of  dcemons.  And  these 
daemons,  under  the  sway  of  ^thiopic  Ariouth, 
are  they  who  enter  into  strife-makers,  to  stir  up 
wars,  so  that  there  may  be  slaughter ;  who 
harden  their  hearts  and  infiame  them  for 
slaughter.
