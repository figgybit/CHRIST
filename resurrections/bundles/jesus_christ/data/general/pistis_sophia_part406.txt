the  treasure  of  light,  but  do  not  set  them  in  the

they  preserve  them  from  every  chastisement  and 
set  them  in  the  treasure,  separated  and  apart,

they  may  be  set  in  the  last  of  the  orders  in  the 
treasure,  and  these  souls  shall  be  preserved  from 
all  the  chastisements  of  the  judgments."

said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  Understand  ye  how  I 
speak  unto  you  ? "
