lights,  in  whom  I  have  trusted,  leave  me  not  in 
the  darkness  until  the  end  of  my  time.  Aid 
me,  and  save  me,  in  thy  mysteries.  Incline 
thine  ear  unto  me,  and  save  me.  May  the 
power  of  thy  light  protect  me,  and  carry  me  to 
the  seons  of  the  height ;  for  it  is  thou  who  shalt 
save  me,  and  take  me  into  the  height  of  thy
