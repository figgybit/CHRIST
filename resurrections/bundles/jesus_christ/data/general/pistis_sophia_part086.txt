is  in  the   Thebaico-Coptic  dialect  like  the    Pistis  Sophia.

XXXn  INTEODUCTION.

Some  twenty  leaves  at  least  are  missing,  and  even  when 
Bruce  fonnd  it  it  was  in  a  very  dilapidated  condition. 
It  was  further  injured  by  neglect  and  damp  in  the 
Bodleian,  when  Woide  found  it  and  carefully  copied  it. 
Woide  considered  that  it  was  the  Egyptian  form  of  the 
Pistis  Sophia  written  by  Valentinus  in  Coptic.  It  is,  how- 
ever, evidently  a  translation  like  the  Pistis  Sophia  from 
the  Greek,  and  like  the  Pistis  Sophia  is  crammed  full  of 
the  Greek  original  technical  terms.  Schwartze  also  copied 
it.  In  1891  Amelineau  published  a  text  and  a  French 
translation  at  Paris,  and  in  1892  Schmidt  published  a  text 
and  a  German  translation  at  Leipzig.

Schmidt  has  sorted  out  this  puzzling  chaos  of  leaves 
with  the  following  results  :

The  Codex  consists  of  tw^o  treatises  quite  distinct  in 
matter  and  character.  The  first  is  divided  into  two  parts, 
the  two  Books  of  leou,  under  the  general  title,  The  Book 
of  the  Great  Logos  according  to  the  Mystery  [?  of  leou]. 
The  second  treatise  has  no  title,  and  is  followed  by  a  long 
Hymn  to  the  Gnosis,  also  without  title.  The  First  Book  of 
leou  opens  with  the  title,  "  This  is  the  Book  of  the  Know- 
ledge of  the  Invisible  God."

One  thing  is  abundantly  clear  on  every  page,  namely, 
that  we  are  dealing  with  a  MS.  which  contains  the  ideas 
of  the  same  school  as  that  to  which  the  Pistis  Sophia  and 
the  Books  of  the  Saviour  belong.  In  fact,  the  longer  Extract 
from  the  Books  of  the  Saviour  practically  gives  the  same 
account  of  the  three  baptisms  as  that  found  in  far  greater 
fulness  in  the  Codex  Brucianus.
