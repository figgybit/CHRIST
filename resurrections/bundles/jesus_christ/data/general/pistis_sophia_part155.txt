that  hate  me,  and  from  the  pit  of  the  waters. 
Let  not  the  water-flood  drown  me,  neither  let 
the  deep  devour  me,  let  not  the  pit  seize  me 
with  its  mouth.       Hear   me,    0    lord,    for   thy 
mercy  is  sweet.     According  to  the  multitude  of 
thy  mercies  look  upon  me.     Turn  not  thy  face 
from  thy  servant,  for  I  am  oppressed.     Hear  me 
speedily.     Give  heed  to  my  soul  and  save  it. 
Save  me  from  my  enemies,  for  thou  hast  known 
my  rebuke,  my  shame,  and  my  affliction.     All 
they  who  afflict  me  are  in  thy  sight.     My  heart 
gazeth  on  rebuke  and  misfortune.     I  looked  for 
him  who  should  sorrow  with  me,  but  I  found  him 
not ;    for  him  who  should    comfort  me,   and   I 
found  him  not.     They  have  given  me  gall  for 
meat ;  and  in  my  thirst  they  gave  me  vinegar  to 
drink.    Let  their  table  be  unto  them  a  snare,  a  net, 
a  retribution  and  a  stumbling-block.     Bend  their 
back  for  all  time.     Trample  them  under  foot  in 
thy  anger,  let  the  wrath  of  thy  displeasure  seize 
hold  upon  them.     Let  their  habitation  be  deso- 
late, let  no  one  dwell  in  their  realm ;  for  they 
have  persecuted  him  whom  thou  hast  smitten. 
They    have    added    bitterness    to    their    pain. 
Thev   have   added    iniquity    to  their  iniquities. 
Let  them  not  come  into  thy  righteousness  ;  (55) 
let  them  be  wiped  out  of  the  book  of  the  living. 
Let  them  not  be  inscribed  among  the  righteous. 
I  am  poor,  an  endurer  of  grief.     The  salvation
