"  For  this  cause,  therefore,  John  the  Baptist 
^fj'^'ifnth^  prophesied  concerning  me,  saying,  'I 
Baptist.  indeed  baptise  you  with  water  unto 
repentance  and  the  remission  of  your  sins.  But 
he  who  cometh  after  me,  .is  before  me,  whose 
fan  is  in  his  hand,  and  he  shall  purge  his  floor ; 
the  chaff  he  shall  burn  with  fire  unquenchable, 
but  the  wheat  he  shall  gather  into  his  garner.' 
The  power  which  was  in  John,  [thus]  prophesied 
concerning  me,  knowing  that  I  should  bring  the 
mysteries  into  the  world,  to  cleanse  the  sins  of 
those  sinners  who  should  believe  in  me,  and  give 
ear  unto  me,  that  1  might  transform  them  into 
pure  light  and  bring  them  unto  the  light."

And  when  Jesus  had  thus  spoken,  Mary 
answered  and  said  :  "  Again,  0  Master,  if  men 
begin  to  seek,  and  come  upon  the  doctrines  of 
error,  (353)  how  will  they  know  whether  they 
are  thine  or  not  1  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
"  I  have  said  unto  you  aforetime,  '  Be  ye  as 
wise  money-changers,'  that  is  to  say,  take  ye 
what  is  good,  but  reject  that  which  is  evil.
