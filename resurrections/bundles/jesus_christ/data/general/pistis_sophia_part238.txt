"  And  the  word  which  thy  light-power  uttered 
through  David,  '  He  will  give  commandment  to 
his  messengers  concerning  thee,  to  keep  thee  in 
all  thy  ways,  to  bear  thee  in  their  hands,  lest 
thou  dash  thy  foot  against  a  stone ' ;  that  is  to 
say  also,  thou  hast  given  commandment  to 
Gabriel  and  Michael  to  guide  Pistis  Sophia  in 
all  the  regions  of  chaos,  to  bear  her  in  their 
hands  until  they  had  helped  her  rise  up,  so  that 
her  feet  should  not  touch  the  lower  darkness, 
and  they  of  the  lower  darkness  should  not  seize 
hold  of  her.

"  And  the  word  which  thy  light-power  spake 
through  David,  '  Thou  shalt  trample  on  the

hath  had  trust  in  me,  I  will  save  him,  and  I  will 
shelter  him,  because  he  hath  known  my  name ' ;

had  serpent  heads,  and  basilisk  heads,  and  seven 
heads ;  and  she  trod  under  foot  that  lion-faced 
power,  and  that  dragon-headed  one,  because  she 
had  trusted  in  the  light,  and  it  had  saved  her 
from  them  all.

"  This,  0  Master,  is  the  interpretation  of  the 
words  which  thou  hast  said."

heard  these  words,   that  he  said  :   "  Well  said, 
James,  thou  well  beloved."

(148)  And  the  first  mystery  again  continued 
in  his  conversation,  and  said  to  his  disciples  : 
"  It  came  to  pass,  when  I  had  led  Pistis  Sophia 
out  of  chaos,  that  she  cried  out  anew,  say-
