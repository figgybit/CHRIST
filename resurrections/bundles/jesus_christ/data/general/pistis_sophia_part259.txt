region.  And  Adamas  will  aid  it  in  this  ;  but 
I  will  take  away  all  the  light-powers  which  are 
in  him,  and  I  will  give  them  unto  thee  ;  and  I 
will  come  to  take  them  away.  Now,  therefore, 
when  they  shall  constrain  thee  at  that  time, 
sing  a  song  to  the  light ;  I  will  hasten  unto  thy 
help ;  I  will  quickly  come  unto  thee  from  the 
regions  below  thee  ;  I  will  come  to  this  region 
where  I  shall  have  left  thee,  and  which  is  below 
the  thirteenth  aeon,  until  I  shall  make  thee 
once  more  quickly  enter  into  thy  region,  whence 
thou  didst  come  forth.'

(169)  "  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Pistis 
Sophia  had  heard  these  words  which  I  spake, 
that  she  rejoiced  with  great  rejoicing.  And  so 
I  left  her  in  the  region  below  the  thirteenth 
seon  ;  I  passed  into  the  light,  and  ceased  to  busy 
myself  about  her."

All  these  things,  therefore,  the  first  mystery 
spake  unto  his  disciples,  for  they  had  happened 
unto  Pistis  Sophia ;  he  was  seated  on  the  Mount 
of  Olives,  narrating  all  these  things  in  the  midst 
of  his  disciples.  He  continued,  therefore,  in  his 
conversation,  and  said  unto  them  :  "  It  came  to 
pass,  therefore,  after  all  these  things,  when  I 
was  in  the  world  of  men,  sitting  beside  the  way, 
that  is  to  say,  in  the  place  which  is   The  time
