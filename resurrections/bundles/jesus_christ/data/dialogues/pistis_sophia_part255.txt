hath  led  me  on  high,  it  hath  set  me  in  an  seon 
lofty  and  firm.  It  hath  set  me  on  the  path 
which  leadeth  to  my  region,  and  hath  given 
unto  me  a  new  mystery,  which  is  not  that  of 
my  seon.  It  hath  given  unto  me  a  song  of 
light.  Now,  therefore,  0  light,  the  rulers  shall 
see  what  thou  hast  done  ;  (165)  they  shall  fear, 
and  they  shall  believe  in  the  light.'

"  This  song,  therefore,  Pistis  Sophia  uttered, 
rejoicing  that  she  had  been  led  out  of  chaos  and 
brought  into  regions  below  the  thirteenth  seon. 
Now,  therefore,  let  him  whose  mind  is  stirred, 
and  who  understandeth  the  interpretation  of 
the  meaning  of  the  song,  which  Pistis  Sophia 
uttered,  come  forward  and  expound  it."

And  Andrew  came  forward  and  said  :  "  My 
Master,  this  is  what  thy  light-power  prophesied 
of  old  concerning  thee  through  David,  saying  :

"  '  With  tarrying  I  waited  for  the  lord,  and 
he  hath  inclined  his  ear  unto  me,  and  Andrew  in- 
hath  heard  my  prayer.  He  hath  JXthf 
brought  my  soul  out  of  the  pit  of  P^^-ims. 
wretchedness,  and  from  the  mire  of  the  mud  ;  he 
hath  stablished  my  feet  on  a  rock,  and  hath 
directed  my  steps.  He  hath  put  in  my  mouth  a 
new  song  and  benediction  for  our  God.  Many 
shall  see  and  shall  fear,  and  shall  hope  in  the 
lord.' "

It  came  to  pass,  when  Andrew  had  expounded

166  PISTIS   SOPHIA.

the  meaning  [of  the  song]  of  Pistis  Sophia,  that 
the  first  mystery  said  unto  him  :  "  Well  said, 
Andrew,  thou  blessed  one."
