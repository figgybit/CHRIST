"  After  that,  it  is  brought  into  the  way  of  the 
midst,  that  each  of  the  rulers  of  the  way  of  the 
midst  may  chastise  it  with  the  smoke  of  his 
darkness  and  his  malignant  fire  for  another 
three  months,  eight  days  and  two  hours.

"  After  that,  it  is  brought  unto  the  virgin  of 
light,  who  judgeth  the  righteous  and  the  sinners, 
that  she  may  judge  it,  and,  when  the  sphere 
turneth,  she  handeth  it  over  unto  her  receivers 
that  they  may  cast  it  into  the  seons  of  the 
sphere,  and  bring  it  unto  the  lake  below  the 
sphere,  so  that  this  [lake]  becometh  a  seething 
fire,  which  eateth  into  it,  (384)  until  it  is 
mightily  purified.

"  Then  cometh  laluham,  the  receiver  of  Saba- 
6th  Adamas,  to  bring  it  the  draught  of  oblivion, 
and  give  it  unto  the  soul,  that  it  may  drink 
thereof  and  forget  every  place  and  every  region 
through  which  it  hath  passed,  and  be  cast  into 
a  body  lame,  halt  and  blind.

"  This  is  the  punishment  of  the  thief."

done  unto  him  ?  "

Jesus  said :  "In  the  case  of  such  a  man, 
when  his  time  is  accomplished  by  the  Thepunish- 
sphere,  the  receivers  of  Ariel  come  ™emptu! 
after  him  to  lead  out  his  soul,  and  °^^' 
travel  round  the  world  with  it  for  three  days, 
instructing  it  in  the  creatures  of  the  world.

"  Then  it  is  brought  below  into  Amenti  unto 
Ariel,  that  it  may  be  chastised  in  his  torments 
for  twenty  months.
