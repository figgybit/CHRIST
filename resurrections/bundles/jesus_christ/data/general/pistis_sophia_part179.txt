means  of  salvation  and  mysteries  for  those  who 
seek  the  region  of  its  inheritance  and  its  mys- 
teries, because  of  the  mystery  of  thy  name,  0 
light.  Remit  my  transgression,  for  it  is  great. 
Whoever  trusteth  in  the  light,  to  him  will  it  give 
the  mystery  that  it  will ;  and  his  soul  shall  be 
in  the  region  of  the  light,  and  his  power  shall 
have  its  portion  in  the  treasure  of  light.  (79) 
It  is  the  light  which  giveth  power  to  them  that 
believe  in  it ;  and  the  name  of  its  mystery  is 
with  them  that  trust  in  it.  It  shall  instruct 
them  concerning  the  region  of  the  inheritance 
which  is  in  the  treasure  of  light.

"  '  As  for  me,  I  have  for  ever  trusted  in  thy 
light,  for  it  is  [the  light]  which  shall  preserve 
my  feet  from  the  bonds  of  the  darkness.  Give 
heed  unto  me,  0  light,  and  save  me,  for  they 
have  taken  my  name  from  me  in  chaos.  Be- 
cause of  all  the  emanations,  my  tribulations  and 
my  affliction  are  multiplied  exceedingly.  Save 
me  from  my  transgression  and  from  this  dark- 
ness, and  look  upon  the  grief  of  my  affliction. 
Eemit  my  transgression.  Give  heed  to  the 
rulers  of  the  twelve  aeons  who  have  hated  me 
through  jealousy ;  watch  over  my  power  and 
save  me.  Leave  me  not  to  dwell  in  this  darkness, 
for  I  have  trusted  in  thee,  (J  light.  Now,  there- 
fore, 0  light,  save  my  powers  from  the  emana- 
tions of  Arrogant,  whereby  I  am  constrained.'
