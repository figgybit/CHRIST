The  original  Greek  treatise  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  was 
compiled  by  Valentinus  in  the  latter  half  of  the  second 
century,  perhaps  in  Alexandria.  By  "compiled"  I  mean 
that  the  Apocalypse  of  Sophia,  or  whatever  its  title  may 
have  been,  was  not  invented  from  first  to  last  by  Valentinus. 
The  traditional  framework  of  the  narrative,  the  selection  of 
texts  and  passages  from  other  scriptures,  Hebrew,  Christian, 
Egyptian,  Chaldaean,  iEthiopic,  etc.,  or  whatever  they  may 
have  been,  and  the  adaptation  of  nomenclature,  were  his 
share  of  the  task ;  but  it  is  evident  that  in  many  places  he 
was  translating  or  paraphrasing  himself,  and  that  he  had 
great  difficulty  in  turning  some  of  the  Oriental  terms  into 
Greek,  the  original  of  the  name  Pistis  Sophia  being  not 
the  least  difficult  of  such  '    &gt;     i  ;â–      left  in  its

present  barbaric  and  un-Greek  form.

Of  this  original   of  Valentinus  doubtless  several  copies
