And  Philip  answered  and  said  unto  Jesus  : 
"  Master,  on  account  of  what  mystery  hast  thou 
changed  the  manner  in  which  were  bound  the 
rulers,  their  aeons,  and  their  fate,  their  sphere, 
and  all  their  regions ;  and  why  hast  thou 
plunged  them  into  dire  confusion  in  their  path  ; 
and  why  do  they  wander  in  their  course  ?  Hast 
thou  done  this  unto  them  for  the  salvation  of 
the  world,  or  hast  thou  not  ?  "

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Philip, 
Why  the  and  to  all  the  disciples  together:  (33) 
Ent!'^!?'  "I  liave  changed  their  path  for  the 
changed.  salvation  of  all  souls.  Amen,  amen,  I 
say  unto  you,  if  I  had  not  changed  their  path, 
they  would  have  destroyed  a  host  of  souls,  and 
a  long  period  would  have  elapsed  before  the 
rulers  of  the  aeons  would  have  been  dissolved, 
together  with  the  rulers  of  the  fate  and  of 
the  sphere,  of  all  their  regions,  and  of  all 
their  heavens,  with  those  of  all  their  aeons ; 
and  the  souls  would  have  continued  without 
this  region  a  long  period  of  time,  and  the 
number  of  perfected  souls  would  have  been 
kept  back  from  its  accomplishment,  of  those 
souls  which  shall  be  counted  in  the  heritage 
of  the  height,  by  means  of  the  mysteries,  and

shall  dwell  in  the  treasure  of  light.  For  this 
cause,  therefore,  I  changed  their  path  that  they 
might  be  disturbed  and  thrown  into  confusion, 
so  that  they  might  lose  their  power,  which  is 
in  the  matter  of  their  world,  which  they  make 
into  souls,  in  order  that  they  might  be  quickly 
purified  ;  that  those  who  are  to  be  saved,  they 
and  all  their  power,  might  be  carried  on  high, 
while  those  who  are  not  to  be  saved,  might  be 
quickly  resolved."
