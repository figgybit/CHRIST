"It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Pistis 
Sophia  saw  her  fellow  invisibles,  that  she  rejoiced 
with  great  joy,  and  was  exceedingly  glad.  She 
longed  to  tell  them  of  the  wonderful  things 
which  I  had  done  for  her  below  in  the  world  of 
men,  until  I  had  rescued  her ;  [and  so]  she  came 
forward  into  the  midst  of  the  invisibles,  and  in 
their  midst  she  sang  a  song  unto  me,  saying  :

(177)  " '  I  will  confess  thee,  0  light,  for  thou  art

a  saviour,  thou  art  a  deliverer  for  all   sophia

time.     I  will   utter  this   song  to   thy   pifiof^

light,  for  it  hath  rescued  me,  and  freed   J^^Sw

me  from  the  hand  of  the  rulers,  mine    ^^""^i^^^^-

enemies.     Thou    hast   preserved  me   in   all  the

regions,  thou  hast  preserved  me  in  the  heights

and  in  the  depths  of  chaos,  and  in  all  the  aeons 
of  the  rulers  of  the  sphere.  And  when  I  came 
forth  from  the  heights,  I  gazed  into  regions 
where  there  is  no  light  ;  nor  could  I  return  to 
the  thirteenth  seon,  my  abode,  because  there 
was  no  light  in  me,  and  no  power,  for  my  power 
was  utterly  afflicted  ;  but  the  light  hath  pre- 
served me  in  all  my  afflictions.  I  sang  a  song 
unto  the  light ;  it  heard  me  when  I  was  con- 
strained, it  guided  me  in  the  world  of  the  seons, 
to  bring  me  into  the  thirteenth  seon,  my  abode.
