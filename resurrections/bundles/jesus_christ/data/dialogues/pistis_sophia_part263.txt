should  tear  my  soul  in  pieces,  like  vii. 
lions  ;  for  there  is  no  saviour  and  no  deliverer. 
0  lord,  my  God,  if  I  have  done  any  such  thing, 
if  there  hath  been  any  malice  in  my  hands,  if  I 
have  exacted  retribution  from  them  that  have 
recompensed  me  with  evils ;  [then]  let  me  fall 
beneath  my  enemies,  and  be  empty ;  let  mine 
enemy  persecute  my  soul,  let  him  seize  it,  let 
him  trample  down  my  life  on  the  earth,  and  lay 
my  glory  in  the  dust.  (Diapsalma.)  Arise,  0 
lord,  in  thy  wrath ;  raise  up  thy  power  above 
my  enemies ;  arise  in  the  statute  which  thou 
hast  decreed.' "

(173)  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  the 
first  mystery  had  heard  the  words  which  James 
had  spoken,  that  he  said  unto  him  :  "  Well  said, 
James,  thou  well-beloved."

The  first  mystery  continued  again  in  his 
conversation,  and  said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  It 
came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Pistis  Sophia 
had  finished  uttering  the  words  of  her  song, 
that  she  turned  herself  round  to  see  whether 
Adamas  and  his  rulers  had  turned  themselves 
back  to  re-enter  their  seon ;  and  she  saw  them 
pursuing  after  her.  So  she  turned  unto  them 
and  said :

174  PISTIS    SOPHIA.

"  '  Why  run  ye  after  me,   saying  that  I  have 
no  help   to   be  preserved  from  you  ?

Sophia  ad-  •      i         •        i        t    i

dresseth       Now,  therefore,  my  judge  is  the  light,

Adamas  n  i       •  tt  •        i  •         i

and  his        and  he  IS  strong.     He  waiteth  patiently
