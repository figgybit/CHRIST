the  left.  The  matter  of  Barbelo,  then,  is  that 
which  is  in  thy  body  to-day.

"  '  Righteousness  and  peace  have  kissed  each 
other.'  Righteousness  is  thyself,  who  didst  bring 
all  the  mysteries,  by  order  of  thy  father,  the 
first  mystery  looking  within ;  and  thou  didst 
baptise  this  power  of  Sabaoth  the  good,  and  thou 
didst  go  into  the  region  of  all  the  rulers  ;  thou 
didst  give  them  the  mysteries  of  the  height ;

good.

indeed  is  thy  soul,  which  entered  into  the 
matter  of  Barbelo,  and  all  the  rulers  of  the  six 
aeons,  or  labraoth,  made  peace  with  the  mystery

the  region  of  those  of  the  left,  it  entered  into 
the  matter  of  Barbelo,  and  proclaimed  unto  them 
the  mysteries  of  the  region  of  truth.

(128)  "  Righteousness  also  which  '  looked  down 
from  heaven,'  is  thyself  the  first  mystery  looking 
without,  come  forth  from  the  spaces  of  the 
height,  with  the  mysteries  of  the  kingdom  of 
light ;  and  thou  didst  descend  upon  this  light- 
vesture,  which  thou  didst  receive  from  the  hands 
of  Barbelo,  which  [vesture]  is  Jesus,  our  saviour, 
descending  upon  him  like  a  dove."
