And  the  saviour  answered,  in  great  compassion 
unto  her,  and  said  :  "  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you, 
not  only  will  I  reveal  unto  you  every  matter  on 
which  ye  shall  question  me,  but  henceforth  I 
will  reveal  unto  you  other  matters  of  which  ye 
think  not  to  question  me,  matters  which  have 
not  yet  dawned  upon  the  heart  of  man,  of  which 
even  all  the  rest  of  the  gods  who  are  among 
men  are  ignorant.  Now,  therefore,  0  Mary,  ask 
what  thou  wilt,  and  I  will  reveal  it  face  to  face, 
without  parable."

Mary  answered  and  said:  (298)  "Well,  then, 
0  Master,  of  what  type  are  the  baptisms  which 
remit  sins  ?  I  have  heard  thee  say,  '  The  work- 
men of  wrath  follow  the  soul,  bearing  witness  to 
all  its  sins,  that  they  may  rebuke  it  in  the  judg- 
ments.' Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  do  the  mys- 
teries of  the  baptisms  cause  the  sins  which  are  in 
the  hands  of  the  workmen  of  wrath  to  disappear 
so  that  they  forget  them  ?     Now,  therefore,  0

Master,  tell  unto  us  the  types  of  the  remission 
of  sins  ;  nay,  we  would  know  them  with  pre- 
cision."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  :
