"  '  But  thou,  lord,  thou  art  for  ever,  and  thy 
remembrance  is  from  generation  to  generation. 
Arise,  therefore,  and  have  mercy  upon  Sion,  for 
the  time  hath  come  to  have  mercy  upon  her, 
yea,  thy  time  hath  come.  Thy  servants  have 
sought  her  stones,  and  will  take  pity  on  her  soil, 
that  the  nation  may  fear  the  name  of  the  lord, 
and  the  kings  of  the  earth  thy  glory  ;  for  the 
lord  shall  build  Sion  to  reveal  himself  in  his 
glory.  He  hath  regarded  the  prayer  of  them 
that  are  humble,  and  hath  not  despised  their 
supplication.  Let  them  write  this  in  another 
book,  and  the  people  that  will  be  engendered 
shall  bless  the  lord,  for  he  hath  looked  down 
from  his  holy  height.  The  lord  hath  gazed 
upon  the  heaven  and  the  earth,  to  hear  the  sighs 
of  them  that  are  bound ;  (67)  to  unloose  the 
children  of  them  whom  they  have  killed,  that 
they  may  utter  the  name  of  the  lord  in  Sion 
and  his  praise  in  Jerusalem.'

mystery  of  the  repentance,  recited  by  Pistis
