Mary  answered  and  said  unto  the  saviour  : 
"  Master,  had  no  soul  entered  into  the  light, 
before  thou  didst  come  into  the  region  of  the 
rulers  and  before  thou  didst  come  into  the  world?"

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto   Mary  : 
"  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you,  before   no  soul 
I   came  into   the   world,   no   soul  had   teredinto 
entered  into  the  light.     But,  now  that   befor^the 
I  am  come,  I  have   opened  the  gates   the^fiist" 
of  the  light,  I  have  thrown  open  the   "^y^^^'^- 
ways  that  lead  to   the  light ;  and  now,   there- 
fore, he  who  acteth    worthily  of  the  mysteries, 
shall  receive  the  mysteries,  that  he  may  enter 
into  the  light."

And  Mary  answered  again  and  said  :  "  But, 
Master,  I  have  heard  it  said  that  the  prophets 
are  entered  into  the  light."

The  saviour  answered   and  said  unto  Mary  :

"  Amen,    amen,    I    say   unto    you,   no   None  of 
'  '  /  /      '  the  pro-

prophet  hath  entered  into  the  light,  but   p^ets  had

been  in-

the  rulers  of  the   ?eons  who  spake   to    itiated. 
them  out  of  the  aeons,  have  given  unto  them  the 
mysteries  of  the  ?eons.     And  when  I  went  into 
the  region   of  the   aeons,   I    turned  back  Elias 
and  despatched  him  into   the  body  of  John  the

Baptist,  and  the  others  also  I  turned  back  into 
righteous  bodies,  which  will  find  the  mysteries 
of  the  light,  (356)  and  mount  into  the  height 
and  inherit  the  kingdom  of  light.
