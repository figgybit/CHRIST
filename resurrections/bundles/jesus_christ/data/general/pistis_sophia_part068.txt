To  this  may  be  added,  as  connected  with  the  magical  side 
of  the  subject,  some  Greek  Papyri  mostly  in  fragments. 
Two  of  the  Ley  den  Papyri  of  the  third  century  have 
recently  been  edited,  translated,  and  commentated  upon 
by  A.  Dieterich  (Abraxas  :  Studien  zur  Religionsgeschichte 
des  Spatern  Altertums ;  Leipzig,  1891);  the  London  and 
Parisian  Papyri,  of  the  third  or  fourth  century,  have  been 
edited  by  Wessely  ;  in  1852  C.  W.  Goodwin  also  did  some 
good  work  on  the  subject  (Fragment  of  a  Grteco-Egyptian 
Work  upon  Magic  from  a  Papj-rus  in  the  British  Museum, 
Cambridge  Antiquarian  Society,  Octavo  Series,  No.  2 ; 
Goodwin  edited,  translated  and  annotated  this  fragment). 
Amelineau  (P.  S.,  Intr.  iv.)  says  that  Rossi  (F.),  the 
Egyptologist  of  Turin,  has  published  a  papja'us  containing 
an  invocation  similar  to  those  in  the  Pistis  Sophia,  but  I 
have  not  been  able  to  find  this  work.  It  is  not  in  I  Papyri 
Copti  del  Museo  Egizio  di  Torino  which  Rossi  transcribed 
and  translated  (Turin,  1887-1892).

There  is  also  a  short  Hebrew  treatise.  The  Sword  of 
Moses  (Cod.,  Oxford,  1531,  6;  Cod.  Heb.,  Gaster,  178;  see 
Caster's  text  and  translation.  Journal  of  Royal  Asiatic 
Society,  1896,  i.  and  ii.).

The  above  magical  works,  however,  are  more  connected 
with  the  superstitions  of  sorcery  than  with  magic  proper, 
and  when  attached  to  Gnosticism  characterise  its  degrada- 
tion in  the  hands  of  the  superstitious  and  ignorant.
