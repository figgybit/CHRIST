The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  John  : 
"  When  ye  shall  have  entered  into  a  qi  hypo- 
city  or  a  town,  unto  the  house  into  rece1ve\h°e 
which  ye  shall  enter  and  in  which  ye  mysteries. 
shall  be  received,  give  ye  one  of  the  mysteries ; 
if  they  be  worthy  of  it,  ye  shall  surely  win  their 
souls  and  they  shall  inherit  the  kingdom  of 
light ;  but  if  they  be  not  worthy  of  it,  but  have 
deceived  you,  and  have  made  a  [mere]  mock  of 
the  mysteries,  mimicking  you  and  the  mysteries, 
(273)  [then]  shall  ye  appeal  to  the  first  mystery 
of  the  first  mystery  who  hath  compassion  on  all 
the  world,  saying,  '  The  mystery  which  we  have 
given  unto  these  impious  and  iniquitous  souls, 
they  have  not  performed  in  a  manner  worthy  of 
thy  mystery,  but  they  have  [merely]  copied 
[what  we  did] ;  give  back  [therefore]  that 
mystery  unto  us,  and  make  them  for  ever 
strangers  to  the  mystery  of  thy  kingdom.' 
Shake  ye  off  the  dust  of  your  feet  as  a  testimony 
against  them,  and  say  unto  them,  '  May  your 
souls  be  as  the  very  dust  of  your  house.'  Amen, 
I  say  unto  you,  in  that  hour  all  the  mysteries 
which  ye  have  given  unto  them  shall  return 
unto  you  ;  every  word  and  every  mystery  of 
which  they  shall  have  received  the  form  shall  be

taken  from  them.
