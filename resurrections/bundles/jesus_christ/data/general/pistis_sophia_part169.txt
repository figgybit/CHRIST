" '  Now,  therefore,  0  light,  surely  thou  wilt 
fulfil  thy  commandment  in  chaos.  Surely  the 
saviours,  who  should  come  by  thy  command, 
surely  they  will  arise  in  the  darkness  and  come 
to  learn  of  thee  ?  Surely  they  will  utter  the 
mystery  of  thy  name  in  chaos  ?  Surely,  at 
least,  they  will  utter  thy  name  in  the  matter  of 
chaos,  [the  name]  whereby  thou  wilt  illuminate 
it?

" '  But,  as  for  me,  I  send  forth  a  song  unto 
thee,  0  light,  and  my  repentance  shall  reach 
unto  thee  in  the  height.  (69)  Let  thy  light 
come  upon  me,  for  they  have  taken  away  my 
light,  and  I  am  in  affliction  because  of  the  light 
from  the  time  I  was  made  to  emanate ;  when  I 
gazed  into  the  height  towards  the  light,  and  I 
gazed  below  towards  this  light-power  which  is  in 
chaos ;  when  I  rose  up  and  fell  down.  Thy 
commandment  hath  come  upon  me,  and  the 
terrors,  which  thou  didst  decree,  have  thrown 
me  into  confusion ;  they  have  surrounded  me  in

FIRST   BOOK.  69

numbers  like  water,  they  have  seized  upou  me 
by  thy  commandment,  and  thou  hast  not  suffered 
my  fellow-emanations  to  help  me,  nor  hast  thou 
permitted  my  companion  to  save  me  in  my 
tribulations.'

"  This  is  the  fifth  repentance  which  Pistis 
Sophia  recited  in  the  chaos,  when  all  the  material 
emanations  of  Arrogant  began  [again]  to  con- 
strain her."

Jesus,  therefore,  having  spoken  these  words 
unto  his  disciples,  said  unto  them  :  "  He  that 
hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear ;  and  let  him  in 
whom  his  mind  seethes,  come  forward,  and 
expound  the  interpretation  of  the  meaning  of 
the  fifth  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia."
