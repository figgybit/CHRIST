ravish  it ;  they  shall  lead  it  along  the  way  of 
the  sunlight,  to  bring  it  to  the  virgin  of  light. 
And  she  will  prove  it,  to  find  it  free  of  all  sin, 
but  will  not  have  it  brought  to  the  light,  because 
the  sign  of  the  kingdom  of  the  mysteries  is  not 
with  it.  But  she  will  seal  it  with  an  excellent 
seal  that  it  may  be  carried  into  a  righteous 
body  of  the  aeons.  (263)  And  [that  man]  shall 
be  good  so  that  he  may  find  the  signs  of  the 
mysteries  of  light,  and  inherit  the  kingdom  of 
lioht  for  ever.

"  And  if  a  man  have  sinned  once,  or  twice,  or 
thrice,  he  shall  be  sent  back  into  the  world

mitted ;  I  will  tell  you  these  types  when  I  shall 
come  to  explain  the  emanation  of  the  pleroma.

"  But  amen,  amen,  I  say  unto  you,  even 
though  a  righteous  man  have  not  committed  any 
sin  at  all,  it  is  impossible  to  take  him  into  the 
kingdom  of  light,  because  the  sign  of  the  king- 
dom of  the  mysteries  is  not  with  him.  In  a 
word,  it  is  not  possible  to  bring  a  soul  into  the 
light  without  the  mysteries  of  light."
