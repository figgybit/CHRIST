CHAPTER 3

CHAPTER 3

And that light-power came down over Jesus and surrounded him entirely, while he was seated removed from his disciples, and he had shone most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was on him.

And the disciples had not seen Jesus because of the great light in which he was, or which was about him; for their eyes were darkened because of the great light in which he was. But they saw only the light, which shot forth many light-rays.

(1) Jesus said: "These are the words which Pistis Sophia uttered in her first repentance, repenting of her sin, and reciting all which had befallen her. Now, therefore, who is sober in spirit, let him come forward and speak the thought of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."

(2) Peter came forward and said: "O Lord, concerning this thy light-power prophesied aforetime through David in the sixty-eighth Psalm, saying thus in the repentance of Pistis Sophia."

THE STORY OF PISTIS SOPHIA

Pistis Sophia desired to enter the Light-world, but she could not. She saw the light of the Treasury and desired to go unto it, but could not reach it. She ceased to perform the mystery of the Thirteenth Aeon, and sang praises to the Light of the Height, which she had seen in the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light.
