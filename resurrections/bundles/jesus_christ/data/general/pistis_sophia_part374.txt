lest  souls  should  escape  from  the  region  of  chaos, 
and  in  order  that  they  may  rebuke  the  soul  in 
the  judgments  which  are  within  chaos  ;  and  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit  beareth  witness  to  every 
sin  which  the  soul  hath  committed,  that  it  also 
may  rebuke  it  in  the  judgments  which  are  with- 
out chaos  ;  not  only  doth  it  bear  witness  con- 
cerning the  sins  of  the  souls,  but  it  sealeth  every 
sin  that  it  may  be  stamped  on  the  soul,  so  that 
all  the  rulers  of  the  torments  of  sinners  may 
know  that  it  is  the  soul  of  a  sinner,  and  may  be 
informed  of  the  number  of  sins  which  it  hath 
committed,  by  the  number  of  seals  which  the 
counterfeit  of  the  spirit  hath  stamped  upon  it, 
so  that  they  may  chastise  it  according  to  the 
number  of  sins  which  it  hath  committed.  (300) 
This  is  the  fashion  in  which  they  treat  the  soul 
of  the  sinner.
