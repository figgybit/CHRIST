The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
Of  the  "  -^Q^  Qj^jy  g^pg  they  more  painful  than

seventy  of  j  j  r

the  dragon,  but  cvcry  soul  that  shall  be  carried  into 
that  region  shall  be  imprisoned  in  relentless  ice, 
in  the  hail  and  scorching  fire  which  are  therein. 
And  in  the  dissolution  of  the  world,  that  is  to 
say  in  the  ascension  of  the  pleroma,  these  souls 
shall  perish  in  the  relentless  ice  and  scorching 
fire,  and  shall  be  non-existent  for  the  eternity."

Mary  answered  and  said  :  "  Woe  for  the  souls 
of  sinners  !  Now,  therefore,  0  Master,  whether 
is  the  fire  in  the  world  of  human  kind  or  the  fire 
in  Amenti  the  fiercer  ?  "

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  : 
Ofthevari-   "Amen,  I  say  unto  thee,  the  fire  in

ous  degrees  '  -^

of  the  fires    Amenti  scorcheth  far  more  than  the  fire

of  the  tor- 
ments, among  men,  nine  times  more.

"  And  the  fire  which  is  in  the  punishments  of 
the  great  chaos  is  nine  times  fiercer  than  the 
fire  in  Amenti.

"  And  the  fire  which  is  in  the  judgments  of

the  rulers  who  are  in  the  way  of  the  midst,  is 
nine  times  fiercer  than  the  fire  of  the  punish- 
ments which  are  in  the  great  chaos.

(325)  "  And  the  fire  which  is  in  the  dragon  of 
outer  darkness,  and  all  the  torments  which  it 
containeth,  are  fiercer  far  than  the  fire  which  is 
in  the  chastisements  and  judgments  of  the  rulers 
who  are  in  the  way  of  the  midst — this  fire  is 
fiercer  than  they  seventy  times."

Mary,  she  smote  her  breast,  she  cried   '^}^^  ^^f-
