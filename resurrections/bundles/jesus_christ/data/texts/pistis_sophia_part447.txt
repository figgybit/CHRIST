After  this  the  disciples  again  said  unto  him  : 
Of  three        "  Master,  reveal  unto  us  the  mystery

there  is  a  baptism  of  the  holy  breath  of  the 
light ;  and  there  is  a  spiritual  chrism  ;  (378) 
these  bring  souls  into  the  treasure  of  light.' 
Reveal  unto  us,  therefore,  their  mystery,  that 
we  also  may  inherit  the  kingdom  of  thy  father." 
Jesus  said  unto  them  :  "As  to  these  mvs-

liirht  of  liofhts,  into  the  reofious  of  truth  and 
righteousness,  into  the  region  of  the  holy  of  all 
holies,  into  the  region  where  there  is  neither 
female  nor  male,  nor  form  in  that  region,  but 
only  light,  unceasing,  ineffable.  No  mystery  is 
hio-her  than  these  mysteries  which  ye  seek 
after,  save  only  the  mystery  of  the  seven  voices 
and  their  nine  and  forty  powers  and  numbers  ; 
the  name  which  is  higher  than  them  all,  the 
name  which  sums  up  all  their  names,  all  their 
lights  and  all  their  powers.

he  shall  have  passed  from  the  body  ^^f^^  ^^

authority,  no  ruler  of  the  sphere  of  the  fate, 
no  angel,  no  archangel,  no  power,  shall  be  able  to 
hold  back  the  soul  that  knoweth  that  name ; 
but  when  it  shall  have  passed  out  of  the  world, 
if  it  uttereth  that  name  to  the  fire,  it  is 
quenched  and  the  darkness  retireth.
