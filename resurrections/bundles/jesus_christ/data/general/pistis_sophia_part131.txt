tions ;   but  now  that  I  have  made  them  turn  to 
the  left  for  six  months  and  turn  to  the  right  for 
six   months,    he    who,    verily,    shall    find   their 
numbering    from    the    time    when    I    changed 
them,  and  when  I  set  them  for  six  months  to 
face   their   left   hand,    and    for    six    months    to 
face    their    right    hand    course,    (31)    he    who, 
verily,   shall   thus  observe    them,  will  discover 
their   influences  with    certainty ;    he  will   fore- 
tell all  that  a  man  shall  do.     In  the  same  way, 
also,  the  diviners,  if  they  invoke  the  name  of 
the  rulers,  if  they  meet  with  them  facing  the  left, 
all  things  which  they  shall  ask  of  their  decans, 
the  latter  will  tell  them  with  accuracy.     But  if 
the   diviners   invoke   their   names   at  the   time 
when  their  revolution  is  to  the  right,  they  will 
not  give  ear  unto  them,  because  they  are  facing 
in  another  way  from  the  first  figure  in  which 
leou  had  placed  them  ;  for  other  are  their  names 
when  they  turn  to  the  left,  and  other  are  their 
names  when  they  turn  to  the  right ;  and  if  they 
are  invoked  when  they  turn  to  the   right,  the 
truth  will  not  be  obtained,  but  confusion  will 
seize  upon  them,  and  with  threatening  they  will 
threaten   them.      Those,  therefore,  who  do  not 
know  their  revolution,  when  they  turn  to  the 
right,  their  three  angles,  and  their  four  angles, 
and  all  their  configurations,  will  find  no  truth, 
but  will  be  greatly  confused,   and    will   be   in
