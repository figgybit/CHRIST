Matter  rejects  the  idea  of  Valentinus,  but  he  had  no 
acquaintance  whatever  with  the  text  and  bases  himself 
entirely  on  Woide.  He  states  that  the  MS.  can  scarcely 
be  prior  to  the  fourth  century,  and  (p.  352)  places  the  date 
of  the  original  treatise  between  the  end  of  the  second  and 
the  end  of  the  fifth.  He  gives  no  opinion  as  to  the  school 
to  which  it  belongs.

XXXVlll  INTRODUCTION.

sur  le  Manuscript  copte-thebain,  intitule  La  Fidele 
Sagesse ;  et  sur  la  Publication  projetee  Ju  Texte  et 
(le  la  Traduction  fran^'aise  de  ce  Manuscript."

On  page  542  Dulaiirier  tells  us  that  he  had  made  a 
French  translation  from  the  Coptic  in  the  following  words  : 
"The  translation  of  the  Pistis  Sophia  and  the  glossary 
which  forms  a  complement  to  it  are  finished,  and  will  be 
sent  to  the  printers,  when  I  have  convinced  myself  that  I 
have  fulfilled  the  requirements  that  this  task  imposes,  taking 
into  consideration  the  present  state  of  science  and  my  own 
capabilities.  The  MS.  from  which  I  have  made  my  transla- 
tion is  a  copy  which  I  have  taken  from  the  original,  during 
my  stay  in  England  in  1838-1840,  w^hen  I  was  charged  by 
MM.  de  Salvandy  and  Villemain,  successive  ministers  of 
public  instruction,  with  the  commission  of  proceeding  to 
London  to  study  this  curious  monument."  Dulaurier, 
however,  did  not  publish  his  labom-s,  nor  have  I  as  yet 
come  across  any  record  of  the  fate  of  his  MSS.  He  ascribes 
the  treatise  to  Valentinus.
