"  After  that,  it  is  carried  into  the  way  of  the 
midst,  that  each  of  the  rulers  of  the  way  of 
the  midst  may  chastise  it  for  another  twenty

"  And  after  that,  it  is  brought  unto  the  virgin 
of  light,  that  she  may  judge  it,  and,  when  the 
sphere  turneth,  she  handeth  it  over  to  her  re-

the  lake  below  the  sphere,  (385)  so  that  this 
lake  becometh  a  seething  fire,  which  eateth

bind  him    by  the  tongue    to  a   great   JJe"bias- 
horse-faced  daemon,  and  travel  round   p^^^^^- 
with    [that   soul]   through   the  world  for  three 
days,  and  punish  him,

"  Then  it  is  brought  into  the  region  of  ice 
and  snow,  to  be  punished  there  for  eleven  years.

"Then  it  is  carried  below  into  chaos  unto 
laklabaoth  and  his  nine  and  forty  daemons, 
that  each  of  his  daemons  may  chastise  it  for 
another  eleven  years.
