from  himself  a  great  lion-faced  power  ; 
and  from  the  matter  which  was  in  him,  he  eman- 
ated a  host  of  other  material  emanations,  very 
violent ;  he  sent  them  into  the  lower  regions, 
into  the  parts  of  the  chaos,  in  order  that  they 
flight  lie  in  wait  for  Pistis  Sophia,  and  take 
away  the  power  that  was  in  her,  because  she 
had  thought  to  go  to  the  height  which  is  above 
them  all ;  because  she  had  ceased  to  do  their 
mystery,  and  continued  to  lament,  seeking  the 
light  which  she  had  seen.  And  the  rulers  who 
stand,  or  remain,  in  the  mystery  which  they 
do,  hated  her,  and  so  also  a]l  the  guardians 
who  are  at  the  gates  of  the  seons.

"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  after  these  things, 
by  commandment  of  the  first  statute,  that  this 
great  arrogant  triple  power,  who  is  one  of  the 
three  triple  powers,  (46)  pursued  Sophia  in  the 
thirteenth  SBon,  to  cause  her  to  gaze  into  the 
lower  parts,  in  order  that  she  might  there  see 
his  light-power  which  hath  the  face  of  a  lion.

and  that  she  might  long  after  it,  that  she  might 
betake  herself  to  that  region  [of  chaos],  and 
that  it  might  take  from  her  the  light  which  was 
in  her.

"  It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  after  these  things,
