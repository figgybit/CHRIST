''  Blessed  are  we  before  all  men  who  are  on  the 
earth,  for  the  saviour  hath  revealed  this  unto 
us,  and  we  have  received  all  fulness  and  all 
perfection."  And  while  they  were  saying  these 
things  the  one  to  the  other,  Jesus  sat  a  little 
removed  from  them.

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  on  the  fifteenth 
^  â€ž^g^^  day  of  the  month  of  Tobe,  the  day  of

came  forth  after  it  a  great  stream  of  light 
shining  exceedingly  ;  there  was  no  measure  to 
the  light  with  which  it  was  surrounded,  for  it 
came  forth  from  the  light  of  lights,  and  it 
came  forth  from  the  last  mystery,  (5)  that  is  to

surrounded  him  entirely.  He  was  seated  apart 
from  his  disciples,  and  was  shining  exceedingly ; 
there  was  no  measure  to  the  light  in  which  he  was.
