agined  violence  all  the  day  long,  like  the  repent- 
the  sharp  razor  oi  a  barber.  Ihou  hast  Psaim  ii. 
acted  guilefully ;  thou  lovedst  evil  more  than 
good ;  thou  lovedst  violence  more  than  to  speak 
righteousness ;  thou  hast  loved  all  words  that 
bring:  about  destruction,  and  a  deceitful  tono;ue. 
Wherefore  shall  God  destroy  thee  utterly,  he 
shall  pluck  thee  forth  and  uproot  thee  from  thy 
dwelling,  and  he  shall  pluck  up  thy  root  to  cast 
it  from  among  the  living.  (Diapsalma.)  The 
just  shall  see,  and  shall  fear,  and  laugh  at  him ; 
they  shall  say,  "  Lo,  a  man  that  took  not  God  for 
his  help,  but  trusted  unto  the  multitude  of  his 
riches,  and  grew  strong  in  his  vanity."  (104) 
But  as  for  me,  I  am  like  a  green  olive  tree  in 
the  house  of  the  lord ;  and  I  have  trusted  in 
the  mercy  of  the  lord  from  eternity  to  eternity. 
I  will  confess  thee,  for  thou  hast  dealt  with  me, 
and  I  will  hope  in  thy  name,  for  it  is  sweet  in 
the  presence  of  thy  holy  ones.'

"  This,  then,  0  Master,  is  the  interpretation 
of  the  eleventh  repentance  of  Pistis  Sophia, 
which  thy  light-power  hath  prompted  me  [to 
utter],  and  I  have  uttered  it  according  to  thy 
will."
