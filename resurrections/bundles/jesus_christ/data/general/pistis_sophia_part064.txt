Not  only  did  the  persecution  of  the  early  Gnostics  cause 
the  loss  of  nearly  all  their  documents,  but  also  some  of  the 
most  important  writings  of  the  Fathers,  which  might  have 
thi'own  more  light  on  the  subject,  have  disappeared  ;  among 
these  may  be  mentioned  the  Syntagma  of  Justin,  and  the 
Syntagma  of  Hippolytus.

Our  chief  authorities  among  the  Fathers  are  Justin  Martyr, 
Irenseus,  Clement  of  Alexandria,  Tertullian,  Origen,  HijDpo- 
lytus,  Philaster,  Epiphaniiis,  Jerome  and  Theodoret.  But 
as  all,  with  the  solitary  exception  of  Hippolytus,  quote  the 
Gnostic  documents  in  the  briefest  possible  manner,  and 
devote  almost  all  their  space  to  the  refutation  of  heretical 
opinions,  it  is  exceedingly  difficult  to  make  out  from  such 
controversial  writings  what  the  real  views  of  the  various 
Gnostic  schools  were ;  and  this  in  spite  of  the  immense 
labour  and  acumen  which  have  been  brought  to  the  task
