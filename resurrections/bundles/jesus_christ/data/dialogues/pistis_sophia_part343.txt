given  him  one  of  the  mysteries  of  the  beginning, 
which  are  in  the  first  space  from  the  exterior, 
after  I  have  given  him  a  number  of  mysteries — 
[if,  I  say,  such  a  brother]  hath  not  become  worthy 
of  the  kingdom  of  the  heavens,  wilt  thou 
that  we  pass  him  on  to  the  mysteries  of  the 
second  space  ?  Perchance  we  shall  win  the  soul 
of  that  brother,  he  might  repent,  and  be  in 
contrition,  and  inherit  the  kingdom  of  the 
heavens  ;  (266)  wilt  thou  or  not  that  we  pass  him 
on  to  the  mysteries  which  are  in  the  second

"[Even  then]  if  he  be  not  worthy  of  the

inherit  the  kingdom  of  the  heavens.
