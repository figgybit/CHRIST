When,  then,  the  saviour  had  thus  spoken 
unto  his  disciples,  he  said  unto  them  :  "  Under- 
stand ye  how  I  speak  unto  you  ? "

Mary  answered  and  said :  "  Yea,  Master, 
Mary  in-  accurately  and  thoroughly  have  I  seized 
th?same^  every  word  which  thou  hast  uttered, 
from  a         Concernins;  this  saying,  then,  thou  hast

of  the  house  should  know  at  what  hour  the  thief 
will  come  in  the  night  to  break  into  the  house, 
he  would  keep  awake  and  not  sufifer  the  fellow 
to  break  into  his  house.' "

And  when  Mary  had  said  these  things  the 
saviour  said  :  "  Well  said,  0  Mary,  thou  spiritual 
one  ;  that  is  the  word."

The  saviour  then  continued  and  said  unto 
his  disciples  :  "  Now,  therefore,  preach  ye  unto 
every  man  who  shall  receive  the  mysteries  in 
the  light,  and  speak  unto  them,  saying,  (311) 
*  Beware  of  falling  back  into  sin,  lest  ye  be  cast 
from  one  into  another,  and  pass  from  your 
body  without  repentance,  and  be  strangers  to 
the  kingdom  of  light  for  ever.' "

And  when  the  saviour  had  said  these  words 
Mary  answered  and  said  :  "  Master,  great  is  the

sins."

The  saviour  answered  and  said  unto  Mary  in 
the  midst  of  the  disciples:   "If  even   n  even  men
