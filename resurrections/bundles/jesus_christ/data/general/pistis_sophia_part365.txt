burning,  in  many  forms,  in  a  word,  in  mighty 
terror  to  which  there  is  no  measure.

"  And  in  that  hour  the  soul  uttereth  the 
mystery  of  their  apology,  and  they  are  stricken 
with  exceeding  great  fear,  and  fall  on  their  faces, 
in  terror  of  the  mystery  which  it  hath  uttered 
and  of  their  apology.  (290)  And  that  soul 
The  apo-  clismisseth  their  destiny,  saying  unto 
rxdersVf^^  them,  '  Take  ye  unto  yourselves  your 
the  midst,  destiny  ;  I  will  not  set  foot  in  your 
region  henceforth  from  this  hour.  I  will  be  a 
stranger  unto  you  for  all  time,  for  I  go  unto  the 
region  of  my  inheritance.'

"When  the  soul  hath  finished  speaking  these 
words,  the  receivers  of  light  will  fly  up  with  it 
into  the  height,  and  bring  it  into  the  seons  of 
the  fate,  where  it  will  pronounce  the  apology  of 
that  region  and  present  its  seals,  all  of  which  I 
will  explain  to  you  in  the  emanation  of  the 
pleroma.  And  it  will  present  the  counterfeit  of 
the  spirit  to  the  rulers,  and  pronounce  for  them 
the  mystery  of  the  bonds  whereby  they  have

rvderf  of^^  yc  uuto  yourselves  your  counterfeit  of 
the  fate.  ^j^^  spirit ;  I  will  not  set  foot  in  your 
region  henceforth  from  this  hour ;  I  will  be  a 
stranger  unto  you  for  all  time.'  And  it  will 
present  unto  each  his  seal  and  his  apology.
