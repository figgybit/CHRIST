(183)  It  came  to  pass,  when  Mary  had  heard 
the  words  which  the  saviour  spake,  that  she 
rejoiced  with  great  joy,  and  was  in  exceeding 
great  gladness ;  she  said  unto  Jesus :  "  My 
Master  and  saviour,  how,  then,  are  the  four 
and  twenty  invisibles ;  of  what  type,  of  what 
quality  ;  or  of  what  quality  is  their  light  ?  "

And  Jesus  answered  and  said  unto  Mary : 
Of  the  four   "  What  is  there  in  this  world  which  is

and  twenty

invisibles,  comparable  to  them  ;  or  what  region 
in  this  world  is  like  unto  them  ?  Now,  there- 
fore, to  what  shall  1  liken  them ;  or  what  shall 
I  say  concerning  them  ?  for  there  is  nothing  in 
this  world  with  which  I  can  compare  them  ;  nor 
is  there  a  single  form  to  which  I  can  liken  them. 
Indeed,  there  is  nothing  in  this  world  which  is 
of  the  quality  of  heaven.  Amen,  I  say  unto 
you,  every  one  of  the  invisibles  is  nine  times 
greater  than  the  heaven  and  the  sphere  above  it, 
and  the  twelve  aeons  all  together,  as  I  have 
already  told  you  on  another  occasion.     [Again]
