Therefore,  thy  power  prophesied,  *  He  will  not 
fear  the  destruction  of  the  daemonial  one  at  mid- 
day '  ;  mid-day,  because  it  came  forth  from  the 
twelfth  aeon,  which  is  mid-day  [the  twelfth  hour]  ; 
and  again  because  it  descended  into  chaos,  which 
is  night,  or  rather  the  night  which  descended  from 
the  twelfth  aeon  which  is  between  the  two. 
Therefore,  thy  light-power  spake  of  mid-day, 
because  the  twelve  aeons  are  between  the  thir- 
teenth and  chaos.

"  And  again  the  word  which  thy  light-power 
spake  through  David,  '  A  thousand  shall  fall  on 
thy  left,  and  ten  thousand  at  thy  right  hand, 
but  they  shall  not  come  nigh  thee  '  ;  that  is  to 
say,  when  the  emanations  of  Arrogant,  which 
were  very  many  in  number,  could  not  stand  the 
great  light  of  the  light-stream,  a  host  of  them 
fell  on  the  left  hand  of  Pistis  Sophia,  and  a  host 
at  her  right,  and  they  could  not  at  all  come 
nigh  her  to  do  her  harm.

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake 
through  David,  '  But  thou  shalt  gaze  upon  them, 
and  thou  shalt  see  the  reward  of  sinners ;  for 
thou,  0  lord,  art  my  hope ' ;  that  is,  that  Pistis 
Sophia  looked  upon  her  enemies,  which  are  the 
emanations  of  Arrogant,  who  had  fallen  all  the 
one  on  the  other ;  (146)  and  not  only  did  she 
gaze  upon  them  in  this  state,  but  thou  also,  my 
Master,  the  first  mystery,  thou  didst  take  away
