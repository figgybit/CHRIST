rent  themselves  asunder,  and  why  they  were 
established,  separated  from  the  [or  into]  twelve 
orders,  and  why  they  emanated  from  the  parent- 
less  which  pertain  to  the  orders  of  the  space  of 
the  ineffable.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  inconceiv- 
ables  which  pertain  to  the  two  spaces  [?  second 
space]  of  that  ineffable  rent  themselves  asunder, 
and  why  they  emanated  from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  twelve 
unmanifestables  rent  themselves  asunder,  and 
why  they  were  established  after  all  the  orders  of 
the  unrevealables,  which  are  also  uncontainable 
impassables,  and  why  they  emanated  from  the 
parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  these  unreveal- 
ables rent  themselves  asunder — [they]  which 
did  not  reveal  themselves,  nor  bring  themselves 
into  manifestation,  according  to  the  regulation  of 
the  one  and  only  ineffable,  (221)  and  why  they 
emanated  from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  super-depths 
rent  themselves  asunder,  and  why  they  set 
themselves  in  one  order,  and  why  they  emanated 
from  the  parentless.

"  That  mystery  knoweth  why  the  twelve  orders 
of  the  unspeakables  rent  themselves  asunder, 
and  why  they  were  divided  into  three  divisions, 
and  why  they  emanated  from  the  parentless.
