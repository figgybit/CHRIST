They  chase  after  the  counterfeit  of  the  spirit  and 
the  destiny,  to  separate  them  from  the  power 
and  the  soul,  and  place  them  with  the  body,  so 
that  the  spiritual  counterfeit,  the  destiny  and  the 
body  may  be  separated  into  one  group,  and  the 
soul  and  power  into  another.  And  the  mystery 
of  baptism  remaineth  between  the  two,  and 
separateth  the  one  from  the  other,  in  order  that 
it  may  cleanse  them  and  make  them  pure,  that 
[the  soul  and  power]  may  not  be  fouled  in 
matter.

"  Now,  therefore,  0  Mary,  this  is  the  way  in 
which  the  mysteries  of  the  baptisms  remit  sins 
and  every  iniquity."

(301)  And  when  the  saviour  had  spoken  these 
words  he  said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  Understand 
ye  how  I  speak  unto  you  ? "

on  the  earth,  and  how  can  I  not  will  that  it 
should  burn  ? '  nay,  thou  didst  explain  it  openly, 
saying,  '  I  have  a  baptism  with  which  to  baptise, 
and  how  shall  1  endure  until  it  be  perfected  ? 
Think  ye  that  I  have  come  to  bring  union  on  the 
earth  ?  Nay,  but  I  am  come  to  bring  separation  ; 
for,  from  this  hour,  five  shall  be  in  one  house, 
three  shall  be  separated  against  two,  and  two 
against  three.'  This,  my  Master,  is  the  word 
which    thou   didst    speak  openly.
