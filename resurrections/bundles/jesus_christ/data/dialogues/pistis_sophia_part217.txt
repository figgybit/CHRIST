[the  body]  which  hath  baptised  the  human  race, 
to  make  it  a  stranger  to  sin,  and  at  peace  with 
thy  spirit,  that  they  may  be  at  peace  with  the 
emanations  of  light,  that  is  to  say,  that  mercy 
and  truth  may  kiss  each  other.  As  to  that 
which  hath  been  said,  '  Truth  hath  flourished 
on  the  earth,'  truth  is  thy  material  body  (122) 
which  germinated  in  me  in  the  earth  among 
men,'  and  is  the  herald  below  the  place  of 
truth.  Again,  as  to  that  which  hath  been  said, 
'  Righteousness  hath  flourished  out  of  heaven,' 
righteousness  is  the  power  which  hath  looked 
down  from  heaven,  [the  power]  which  will  give 
the  mysteries  of  light  to  the  human  race,  and 
men  shall  become  righteous,  they  shall  be  good, 
they  shall  inhabit  the  kingdom  of  life."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Jesus  had 
heard  these  words  which  Mary,  his  mother,  had 
spoken,  that  he  said  :  "  Well  said ;  it  is  well, 
Mary."

And  the  other  Mary  came  forward,  and  said  : 
"  Master,  suffer  me,  and  be  not  wroth  with  me, 
nay,  from  the  moment  when  thy  mother  uttered 
the  interpretation  of  these  words,  my  power 
hath  urged  me  to  come  forward,  and  also  ex- 
pound their  interpretation."

And  Mary  said  :  "  Master,  '  Mercy  and  truth 
are  met  together.'  Mercy,  then,  is  the  spirit 
which   descended    upon    thee,   when  thou   didst
