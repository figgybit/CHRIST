Persephone,  to  be  punished  in  her  torments

"  After  that  it  is  brought  into  the  way  of  the 
midst,  that  each  of  the  rulers  of  the  midst  may 
punish  it  in  the  torments  of  its  regions  another

light,   who  judgeth  the  righteous  and  sinners,

and,  when  the  sphere  turneth,  she  ordereth  it

to  be  cast   into  the   outer  darkness,  until  the

darkness  of  the  midst  shall  be  removed,  so  that

it  may  cease  to  exist  and  be  dissolved.

"  This  is  the  punishment  of  murderers." 
Peter  pro-         Peter  Said  :  "  Master,  let  the  women 
aJaSt  the   come    to   an   end   of   their   questions, 
women.        (333^  ^j^^^  ^^  ^js^  ^-^^^y  question  thee."

Jesus  said  unto  Mary  and  the  [other]  women  : 
"  Give  place  to  your  brethren,  that  they  also 
may  question."

Peter  answered  and  said  :  "  Again,  Master, 
[in  the  case';of]  a  thief,  that  stealeth  secretly, 
and  persisteth*  in  his  sin,  when  he  passeth  out 
of  the  body,  what  is  his  punishment  ? "

Jesus  said  :  "[In  the  case  of]  such  a  man,  when 
The  punish-  his  time  shall  be  accomplished  by  the 
the  thief.  Sphere,  the  receivers  of  Adonis  come 
after  him,  to  lead  his  soul  out  of  the  body,  and 
travel  round  with  it  three  days  instructing  it  in 
the  creatures  of  the  w^orld.

"  Then  it  is  carried  below  into  Amenti  unto 
Ariel,  that  he  may  chastise  it  in  his  torments 
three  months,  eight  days  and  two  hours.

"  Then  it  is  brought  into  chaos  unto  lalda- 
baoth  and  his  nine  and  forty  daemons,  in  order 
that  each  of  his  daemons  may  chastise  it  for 
another  three  months,  eight  days  and  two  hours.
