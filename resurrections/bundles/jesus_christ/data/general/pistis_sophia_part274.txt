there  is  no  light  in  this  world  which  is  superior 
to  that  of  the  sun.  Amen,  amen,  I  say  unto 
you,  the  four  and  twenty  invisibles  are  more 
radiant  than  the  light  of  the  sun  which  is  in 
this  world,  ten  thousand  times,  (184)  as  I  have 
told  you  before  on  another  occasion  ;  for  the 
light  of  the  sun  in  its  true  form  is  not  of  this 
world,  since  its  light  has  to  pierce  through  a 
host  of  veils  of  [various]  regions.  But  the  light 
of  the  sun  in  its  true  form,  which  is  in  the 
region  of  the  virgin  of  light,  is  more  radiant 
than  the  four  and  twenty  invisibles,  and  the 
great  invisible  forefather,  and  also  the  great 
triple-powered  god,  ten  thousand  times  more 
radiant,  as  I  have  already  told  you  on  another 
occasion.

"  Now,  therefore,  0  Mary,  there  is  no  form 
in  this  world,  nor  any  light,  nor  any  shape,  like 
unto  the  four  and  twenty  invisibles,  and  with 
which  I  could  compare  them.  Yet  a  little 
while  and  I  will  bring  thee  and  thy  fellow  dis- 
ciples, thy  brethren,  into  the  three  spaces  of 
the  first  mystery,  but  only  as  far  as  the  space 
of  the  ineffable,  and  ye  shall  see  all  their  con- 
figurations as  they  really  are  and  without  simili- 
tude.

"  And  when  I  bring  you  into  the  height,  you 
shall  see  the  glory  of  them  in  the  height ;  and 
ye  shall  be  in  most  mighty  wonderment.
