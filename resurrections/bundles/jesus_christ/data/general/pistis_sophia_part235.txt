'  He  shall  not  be  afraid  for  the  terror  of  the  night' ; 
that  is,  that  Pistis  Sophia  was  not  afraid  before 
the  terrors  and  troubles  into  which  she  had  been 
sent  in  chaos,  which  is  night.

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake, 
(144)  '  He  shall  not  be  afraid  of  the  arrow  which 
flieth  by  day ' ;  that  is,  that  Pistis  Sophia  was 
not  afraid  before  that  power  which  Arrogant  had 
sent  from  the  top  of  the  heights,  and  which 
descended  into  chaos  like  a  flying  arrow,  just  as 
thy  light-power  prophesied,  '  Thou  shalt  not  be 
afraid  of  the  arrow  that  flieth  by  day  ' ;  for  this 
power  came  forth  from  the  thirteenth  aeon  which 
is  lord  of  the  twelve  aeons  ;  he  it  is  who  is  light 
for  all  the  aeons.  Therefore  he  [David]  hath 
used  the  word  '  day.'

"  And  again  the  word  which  thy  power 
uttered,  '  He  shall  not  be  afraid  of  the  thing 
that  strideth  in  darkness '  ;  that  is,  that  Sophia 
did  not  fear  before  the  serpent-headed  emana- 
tion, which  made  her  afraid  in  chaos,  which  is 
'  darkness,'

"  And  the  word  which  thy  power  spake,  '  He 
will  not  fear  for  the  destruction,  the  daemonial 
one  at  mid-day ' ;  that  is,  that  Pistis  Sophia  was 
not  afraid  before  the  daemonial  emanation  of 
tyrant  Adamas,  which  cast  Pistis  Sophia  to  the 
earth  in  great  destruction,  that  which  came  forth 
from    Adamas,    from    the    twelfth    aeon.     (145)
