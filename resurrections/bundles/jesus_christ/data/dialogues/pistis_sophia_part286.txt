"  Master,  my  indweller  of  light  hath  ears,  and 
^^t^tifth^  I  comprehend  every  word  which  thou 
narrative       sDcakcst.     Now,   therefore,    0  Master,

from  the  ^

scriptures,  concerning  the  word  which  thou  hast 
spoken,  to  wit,  '  All  the  souls  of  human  kind 
which  shall  receive  the  mysteries  of  light,  shall, 
in  the  inheritances  of  light,  take  precedence  of 
all  the  rulers  who  shall  repent,  and  all  them  of 
the  region  of  those  who  are  on  the  right,  and 
the  whole  region  of  the  treasure  of  light ' ;  con- 
cerning this  word,  my  Master,  thou  hast  said 
unto  us  aforetime,  '  The  first  shall  be  last  and 
the  last  shall  be  first,'  that  is,  the  '  last '  are 
the  whole  race  of  men  who  shall  be  first  in  the 
light-kingdom  ;  so  also  they  that  are  in  the 
region  of  the  height  are  the  'first.'  For  this 
cause,  therefore,  0  Master,  didst  thou  say  unto 
us,  '  He  that  hath  ears  to  hear,  let  him  hear,' 
that  is  to  say,  (198)  that  thou  wouldst  know 
whether  we  comprehended  all  the  words  which

thou    hast   spoken    unto    us.       Thus,    then,    0 
Master,  stands  the  matter."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  Mary  had 
finished  saying  these  words,  that  the  saviour 
was  greatly  astonished  at  the  exposition  of  the 
words  which  she  had  given,  for  she  had  become 
pure  spirit  entirely.  And  Jesus  answered  again 
and  said  unto  her :  "  Well  said,  0  spiritual 
and  pure  Mary  ;  this  is  the  interpretation  of 
the  word."

It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  after  all  these 
things,  that  Jesus  continued  in  his  conversation, 
and  said  unto  his  disciples  :  "  Hearken,  while  I 
speak  unto  you  concerning  the  glory  of  them 
that  are  in  the  height,  how  they  are,  just  as  I 
have  spoken  to  you  concerning  them  up  to  this 
day.
