became  feeble  in  their  power,  that  the  light  which 
was  in  their  region,  ceased,  their  kingdom  was 
dissolved,  and  all  quickly  passed  through  it ;  it 
came  to  pass,  therefore,  when  they  began  to 
understand  these  things  in  the  course  of  time, 
and  when  the  number  of  the  reckoning  of 
Melchisedec,  the  receiver,  was  accomplished, 
that  he  came  again,  he  entered  into  the  midst 
of  the  rulers  of  all  the  aeons,  and  into  the  midst 
of  all  the  rulers  of  the  fate,  as  well  as  of  those  of 
the  sphere,  and  he  threw  them  into  confusion, 
and  caused  their  circles  to  be  quickly  abandoned. 
(37)  And  forthwith  they  were  constrained,  and 
cast  forth  their  power  from  themselves  by  the 
breath  of  their  mouth,  by  the  tears  of  their  eyes 
and  the  sweat  of  their  bodies.

be  destroyed,  but  that  they  might  linger,  and 
cause  a  long  delay  to  the  completion  of  the
