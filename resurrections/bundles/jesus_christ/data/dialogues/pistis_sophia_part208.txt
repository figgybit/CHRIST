"  This  is  the  interpretation  of  the  words  which 
Pistis  Sophia  spake."

Jesus  said  unto  her:  "Well  said;  it  is  well, 
Martha,  thou  blessed  one."

And  Jesus  continued  in  his  conversation,  and 
said   unto  his  disciples  :   "It  came  to   jesus

chaos  to  bring  Pistis  Sophia  forth  from  the 
depths  of  chaos,  until  the  command  should  come 
from  the  first  mystery  to  take  her  entirely  out 
of  chaos.  And  my  light-power  led  Pistis  Sophia 
into  the  region  which  is  above  in  the  chaos. 
It  came  to  pass,  when  the  emanations  of 
Arrogant  discovered  that  Pistis  Sophia  had  been 
conducted  into  the  higher  region  of  chaos,  that 
they  also  sped  after  her  into  the  height,  seeking 
to  bring  her  again  into  the  lower  regions  of 
chaos  ;  and  my  light-power,  which  I  had  sent 
unto  Sophia  in  chaos,  was  shining  exceedingly. 
It  came  to  pass,  therefore,  (113)  when  the 
emanations  of  Arrogant  pursued  Sophia,  when 
she  had  been  conducted  into  the  higher  region 
of  chaos,  that  she  again  sang  a  song,  and  cried 
out  unto  me,  saying  :
