"  It  came  to  pass,  after  these  things,  that  I 
Jesus  en-  Came  into  the  height,  to  the  veils 
tSrt^eSh  of  ^^^  thirteenth  aeon.  It  came  to 
findeth'pis-  P^^s,  when  I  had  arrived  at  its

their  own  accord ;  they  opened  before  me ;  I 
entered  into  the  thirteenth  seon,  I  found  Pistis 
Sophia  below  the  thirteenth  aeon,  quite  alone, 
no  one  being  near  her  ;  she  was  sitting  in  that 
region,  grieving  and  mourning,  because  she  had 
not  been  brought  into  the  thirteenth  seon,  her 
proper  region  in  the  height.  And  she  was 
grieving  because  of  the  vexations  which  she 
had  been  made  to  sufifer  by  Arrogant,  who  is 
one  of  the  three  triple  powers.  When  I  come 
to  tell  you  of  their  emanation,  I  will  tell  you  the 
mystery,  how  that  that  had  come  about.
