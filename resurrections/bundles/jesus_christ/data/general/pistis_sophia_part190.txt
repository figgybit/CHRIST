is  in  it.  They  have  constraiDed  the  power  that 
is  in  me,  and  which  they  could  not  take.  Now, 
therefore,  0  light,  take  away  the  glory  of  the 
lion-faced  power,  without  its  knowing,  and  for 
the  thought  which  Arrogant  hath  had  to  take 
my  light,  take  from  him  also  his  [light].  Let 
the  light  be  taken  from  the  lion-faced  power, 
w^hich  hath  laid  snares  for  me.  My  own  power 
shall  rejoice  in  the  light,  it  shall  be  glad  ;  for 
[the  light]  shall  preserve  it,  and  all  the  rays  of 
my  power  shall  say,  "There  is  no  saviour  but 
thee  "  ;  for  thou  shalt  save  me  from  the  hands 
of  this  lion-faced  power  which  hath  taken  my 
power  from  me.  Thou  preservest  me  from  them 
that  have  taken  away  my  power  and  my  light ; 
for  they  have  risen  against  me,  they  have  lied 
against  me,  saying  (91)  that  I  know  the  mys- 
tery of  the  light  which  is  in  the  height,  [the  light] 
in  which  I  trusted  ;  and  they  have  constrained 
me,  saying,  "  Tell  unto  us  the  mysteries  of  the 
light  which  is  in  the  height " â€” [a  thing]  which 
I  knew  not.  They  have  recompensed  me  with 
all  these  evils,  because  I  trusted  in  the  light  of 
the  height ;  and  they  have  deprived  my  power 
of  its  light.  As  for  me,  when  they  constrained 
me,  I  was  seated  in  the  darkness,  my  soul 
humbled  in  mourning.

song,  deliver  me  ;  I  know  that  thou  wdlt  deliver
