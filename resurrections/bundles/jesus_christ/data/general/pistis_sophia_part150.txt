upon  me,  of  him  who  would  not  give  ear  to  thy 
command  to  send  forth  the  emanation  of  his 
power,  for  I  dwelt  in  his  seon,  without  doing  its 
mystery,  and  all  the  rulers  of  the  seons  have 
held  me  in  derision.  And  I  am  in  this  region, 
grieving,  seeking  after  the  light,  which  I  saw 
in  the  height.  And  the  guardians  of  the  gates 
of  the  8eons  have  questioned  me,  and  all  those 
who  keep  to  their  mystery  have  mocked  me. 
But  as  for  me,  I  gazed  into  the  height,  towards 
thee.  0  light  of  lights,  I  am  oppressed  in  the 
darkness  of  this  chaos,  until  it  be  thy  good 
pleasure  to  come  and  save  me.  Great  is  thy 
mercy  ;  hear  me  in  truth,  and  preserve  me,  save 
me  from  the  matter  of  this  darkness,  that  I  may 
no  longer  be  plunged  therein,  that  I  may  be 
saved  from  the  emanations  of  god  Arrogant 
which  constrain  me,  and  from  their  evil  doings. 
Let  not  this  darkness  cover  me,  and  this  lion- 
faced  power,  suffer  it  not  to  devour  the  whole 
of  my  power  entirely,  and  let  not  this  chaos 
hide  my  power.

good,  and  look  upon  me  according  to  the  great 
mercy  of  thy  light ;  turn  not  thy  face  from  me, 
for  I  am  exceedingly  tormented.  Haste  thee 
hearken  unto  me,  and  preserve  my  power.  Save 
me  from  the   rulers    which   hate  me,   for  thou

knowest  my  afflictions,  and  my  danger,  and  the
